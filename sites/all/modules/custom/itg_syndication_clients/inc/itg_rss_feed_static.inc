"We will continuously endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio of 
 the Railways. The tariffs of Railways will be fixed, taking the costs, 
 quality of service, social obligations and competition from other forms 
 of transport into consideration," Jaitley said.

<p>If the country's youngsters want luxurious, speedy train journeys, then they have to be prepared to pay more. Seeking to justify the high rail fare in premium trains like Gatimaan Express as well as Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the tariff would be determined by the quality of service and competition from other modes of transport. </p><p>"We will continuously endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio of the Railways. The tariffs of Railways will be fixed, taking the costs, quality of service, social obligations and competition from other forms of transport into consideration," Jaitley said, while presenting the first rail budget merged with the General Budget. </p><p>Railways are in the process of introducing new luxury trains like Hamsafar and Tejas Express, which will be more expensive than normal trains. Also, the proposed bullet train and the high speed trains will incur higher cost. Jaitley also announced the withdrawal of service charges from tickets booked via IRCTC to promote cashless transaction. </p><p>{}</p><p>IRCTC is likely to lose about Rs 500 crore a year due to this. Jaitley also said that booking of railway tickets via cashless transactions has gone from 58 per cent to 68 per cent. </p><p>Faced with a series of derailments, the Railways got a much needed separate fund for safety upgradation of the rail network with the budget proposing an outlay of Rs 1 lakh crore that will cover the upgradation of tracks and signaling, besides the elimination of unmanned level crossings. </p><p>The budget announced listing three railways PSUs - IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON - in share markets, as well as converting 500 stations into disabled-friendly ones. All the coaches will be equipped with bio-toilets by 2019, and Railways will also have a Clean my coach app. </p><p>Prabhu also mentioned the joint participation with several state governments to execute rail projects, adding that the bidding process for developing 23 stations will begin soon. It was also proposed to feed about 7,000 stations with solar power in the medium term. While this has already been done in 300 stations, work on 2,000 railway stations, as a part of the 1000 MW solar mission, will begin soon. </p><p>The Railway Budget, merged with the General Budget 2017-18, also provides for the commissioning of new railway lines of 3,500 km against 2,800 km in 2016-17. </p><p>Jaitley also announced the plan size for the next fiscal for the Railways at Rs 1,31,000 crore as against Rs 1.21 lakh crore last year. He proposed the creation of 'Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh' (National Rail Safety Fund) with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore.</p><p>{}<br /></p>

]]></kicker><body><![CDATA[
<p>RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife Rabri Devi has gifted West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee a saree during Nitish Kumar's oath-taking ceremony on Friday. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo shared the dais with other political arch-rivals at the ceremony to display a picture of unity opposed to the BJP.</p><p>On Thursday, the Trinamool Congress said that Mamata's presence would be a sign of 'protest against authoritarian attitude of the Centre'.</p><p>The Mamata-Nitish duo have always shared an easy relationship. The TMC chief had left no stone unturned in showing her loyalty to the Grand Alliance. Mamata had urged the people of Bihar to vote for the alliance and re-elect Nitish Kumar as the chief minister of the state. TMC leader and state urban development minister Firhad Hakim had also said that there was a need to defeat the communal forces in the country.</p><p>Congratulating Nitish on Twitter over his victory, Mamata had termed the Grand Alliance win as the defeat of 'intolerance'.</p><p>"Congratulations Nitish Kumarji, Laluji and your full team, and all my Bihar brothers and sisters," the Trinamool Congress tweeted. This, she said, was a "victory of tolerance, defeat of intolerance," she had tweeted.</p><p>On the other side, the Janata Dal (United) has always reciprocated Mamata's efforts towards the party. Last week, the JD(U) had extended its support to the Bengal Chief Minister in her fight against the BJP.</p><p>Nitish Kumar had congratulated the TMC supremo for her party's victory in West Bengal's by-elections. </p><p></p><p>Former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda and chief ministers of nine states, including Arvind Kejriwal, Union ministers and senior BJP leaders Venkaiah Naidu and Rajiv Pratap Rudy attended Nitish's oath taking ceremony at Patna's Gandhi Maidan</p><p>PM Narendra Modi was also invited by Nitish to attend the event. Bihar JD(U) president Basistha Narayan Singh said inviting the Prime Minister was a political etiquette and it was now on him whether to come or not. On being asked about the invitation, Bihar BJP vice president Sanjay Mayukh said that PM due to his "prior fixed programmes" might not be able to attend the ceremony.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Expected Cabinet reshuffle of the Modi government might see the imprint of the Bihar poll debacle. Sources said the reshuffle might witness dropping of some under-performers as the government wants to focus mainly on its development agenda ahead of polls in various states, including Uttar Pradesh. According to party sources, weaknesses and strength of the ministers will be assessed besides the Bihar polls performance.</p><p>Also read: Jaitley-Rahul meet likely to boost govt's GST hope </p><p>"Price rise of essential commodities is one of the main concerns of the government. Ministers who failed to perform as per the expectation might be dropped. Moreover, ministers who are found indulging in unnecessary remarks leading to the embarrassment of the party as well of the government will also be under the scanner," said a party insider. Many ministers have led to the embarrassment of the government and party with their remarks on the Dadri killing, the killing of Dalits in Haryana and the beef controversy - which grabbed unnecessary limelight during the Bihar polls.</p><p>Apart from this, results of Bihar polls will also have its imprint on the Cabinet rejig. Many Union ministers were given responsibility in their respective regions in Bihar during the polls and barring a few, most failed to show results. Even as the senior leadership is of the view that no individual is responsible for the defeat, however, role of senior ministers in the poll management will also be counted, said a source.</p><p>Ministers, including Radha Mohan Singh, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan, Upendra Kushwaha, Ram Kripal Yadav, and Dharmendra Pradhan camped in Bihar for about a month during the assembly elections. However, barring Union Agricultural Minister Radha Mohan Singh, all the ministers have lost majority of seats in their areas. Party registered victory in eight seats in East Champaran where Radha Mohan Singh was camping. Party could only bag two seats from the areas under ministers like Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Ram Vilas Paswan and Giriraj Singh.</p><p>Performances of Kushwaha and Yadav were not better. Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad spent a considerable time in Bihar amidst the issue of call drops. Pradhan and Ananth Kumar were monitoring the poll preparations. Even as senior leaders have made this clear time and again that the Bihar verdict is not a referendum on PM Modi's governance stewardship, but, a party leader said the reshuffle will be an opportunity for a further course correction.</p><p>Party insiders claimed that organisational changes are also expected and some ministers from the Cabinet might be given responsibility of the organisation considering the upcoming state polls. A party leader said the reshuffle might see induction of more faces from UP due to the upcoming state polls and dropping of a few ministers from Bihar. "The PM will send out a strong message to the leaders, particularly to underperformers, through this reshuffle," said the leader.</p>

<p>A surge in crime rate has been witnessed in Bihar in the wake of the massive victory of the Grand Alliance in the recent Assembly elections, throwing a big challenge to chief minister-elect Nitish Kumar, who is due to take oath in Patna on Friday.</p><p>A fertiliser trader Harishankar Singh was kidnapped at gun point while he was on a morning walk at the railway station at Panchrukhi in Siwan district on Sunday.</p><p>Eyewitness told police that Singh was accosted by six armed criminals, who forcibly took him away in a vehicle. Angry over the incident, the locals blocked the national highway as well as the railway tracks disrupting the vehicular and train traffic for several hours.</p><p>Demanding immediate recovery of the abducted businessman, the mob also resorted to arson.</p><p>The cops brought the situation under control after reassuring the people that Singh would be safely recovered. The police subsequently conducted raids at several places but had not recovered him so far.</p><p>The trader's abduction took place a day after a contractor was gunned down in Muzaffarpur district over tender rivalry. On Saturday morning, armed assailants on a motorcycle fired at Dharmendra Yadav from point-blank range at 5:30 am near Sherna village under Kanti police station.</p><p>The 32-year-old victim, who was a railway contractor at Kanti, died on the spot. Irate mob torched a police vehicle and an eatery in protest against the incident. The mob also blocked the national highway, railway lines and assaulted some cops forcing the local policemen to open fire in the air. A police rifle was also looted in the incident which was subsequently recovered.</p><p>The police suspected the killing to be the work of a gang headed by a jailed criminal allegedly over railway tenders. In another incident in Katihar district on Friday night, a liquor trader Shambhu Nayak was shot dead while he was returning home after closing his shop.</p>

<p>Amid growing voices of dissent within the saffron brigade, senior BJP leader and Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday denied that he had suggested any disciplinary action against the party's old guards.</p><p>Meanwhile, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari joined several other party leaders in criticising his party's election strategy in Bihar and lauded the rival JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance for having a better battle plan.</p><p>Tewari said the party failed to convince the people to vote for the BJP candidates in the keenly contested Bihar polls. "We failed to convince people to vote for the party at the Centre and earn maximum benefits. We clearly failed to convey our party agenda to the people of Bihar," he said.</p><p>Also read: Jaitley meets MM Joshi in bid to pacify BJP veterans <br /></p><p>BJP sources claimed that the group of veterans, including LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and others, is apparently in no mood to relent and they may strike further. A party functionary said that the veterans are keenly observing all the developments.</p><p>"A section of leaders in the party is in support of these veterans. These leaders are expecting deliberations over the poor performance of the party in Bihar. It would be no surprise if more such attacks surface in coming days," a party source said.</p><p>Gadkari on Friday said the BJP central leadership is holding discussions with the veterans. "Party elders, including LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, are our highly respected leaders and neither I nor any other party functionary has ever shown any disrespect to them. There was absolutely no question of anyone suggesting calling for an explanation from them and not the least demanding disciplinary action against them," said Gadkari in a statement.</p><p>The Union minister said reports in a section of the media, indicating that he suggested that disciplinary action be initiated against them are absolutely incorrect and misleading.</p><p>Bihar parliamentarian RK Singh also supported the veterans' demand that accountability be fixed for the drubbing. "Accountability has to be fixed. Review should be made of the election debacle. We need to find out what went wrong, who were responsible," he said.</p><p>A number of Bihar BJP MPs like Shatrughan Sinha, Hukumdev Narayan Yadav and Bhola Singh have criticised the party's campaign with the likes of Sinha and Singh drawing the party brass in their line of fire.</p><p>As the party grappled with the rumblings, Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu said the veterans should have raised their views at a party forum rather than going public. He asserted that the country and the party needed PM Narendra Modi's leadership, but said the BJP will take note of these views and concerns.</p><p>"Some of our senior leaders have raised certain issues. It would have been better if these issues were raised in a party forum rather than public, but still we will take note of these. We will discuss with all concerned. The parliamentary board has already decided to take it up with all the concerned and discuss the shortcomings that led to the defeat in Bihar. That has been the practice," Naidu said.</p><p>Responding to a question about the BJP veterans' open revolt, Naidu said, "They have not come out against Modi. They made a comment about the strategy in Bihar. They have not said even a single word against Modi. Only a section of media highlighted this as headlines," he said.</p>

<p>Rejecting the view that sectarian hatred is on the rise under the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, and that the intolerance debate triggered off BJP's poll debacle in Bihar, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said BJP is the most secular party in the country.</p><p>He also offered to have a dialogue with the dissenting writers, filmmakers and artistes, who have returned government awards for protesting against the rising intolerance in the country. "If there is one party that is secular, it is BJP," Singh said.</p><p>Singh has been the only one in the government who has not taken an aggressive stand against those returning awards while the BJP has in the past called it a manufactured protest. "I welcome those returning awards to have a dialogue.

It was nothing controversial. We can't think like that. He had only said that reservation should continue," Singh said.</p><p>Bhagwat had said there is a need to have a fresh look as to who should get the benefit of quota, in comments that kicked up a political storm ahead of the Bihar polls.

The statement was issued late Tuesday evening following a meeting at Murli Manohar Joshi's residence.

<p>Knives are out in the BJP and it is the Old Guard that has drawn first blood.</p><p>Scathing attack on the party's top leadership for the Bihar debacle has come from none other than party veterans L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha and others.</p><p>Two days after the crushing defeat in the crucial polls and a day before Diwali, the veterans on Tuesday lashed out at Team Modi.</p><p>"The results of the Bihar elections show that no lesson has been learnt from the fiasco in Delhi," said the opening line of the statement which bore the signature of party veteran and former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha.</p><p>Also read: People saw a Lalu in PM, says Begusarai MP Bhola Singh <br /></p><p>The brief but strongly-worded statement was issued following a meeting at the residence of Murli Manohar Joshi on Tuesday evening. Party veterans L K Advani, Arun Shourie and K N Govindacharya were present in the meeting wherein they deliberated upon the current situation in the party apart from the loss the BJP faced in the Bihar polls.</p><p>This is first such attack on the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah in which the stalwarts have also raised questions over the explanation of the party's senior leaders that no individual is responsible for the defeat in Bihar polls and the loss was because of wrong caste arithmetic. While pulling the senior leadership up for shrugging off responsibility, the veterans demanded that accountability for the loss should be fixed.</p><p>"To say that everyone is responsible for the defeat in Bihar is to ensure that no one is held responsible. It shows that those who would have appropriated credit if the party had won are bent on shrugging off responsibility for the disastrous showing in Bihar," said the statement.</p><p>Also read: Post victory, Nitish's poll strategist Prashant Kishor gets Mamata's invite <br /></p><p>The old guard also raised serious questions over the style of functioning in the party wherein power lies in a few hands. The veterans said that the way the party has been functioning since the past one year has weakened the organisation and that is the main reason behind the loss in Bihar polls. "The principal reason for the latest defeat is the way the party has been emasculated in the last year," said the statement.</p><p>Asking for review of the defeat, the veterans said that there should also be an analysis on how the party has been forced to kowtow to a handful. The veterans also warned that this style of functioning has destroyed the consensual character of the party.</p><p>"A thorough review must be done of the reasons for the defeat. As well as of the way the party is being forced to kowtow to a handful, and how its consensual character has been destroyed," said the statement.</p><p>In a veiled attack on PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, the brief note issued by the veterans said that the review of the loss must not be done by those who managed and were responsible for the Bihar campaign.</p><p>Also read: BJP ran negative campaign in Bihar, says Badal Jr <br /></p><p>"This review must not be done by the very persons who have managed and who have been responsible for the campaign in Bihar," the note said.</p><p>The statement was planned at a short notice on Tuesday evening and it was issued at around 9 pm following the meeting at Joshi's house.</p><p>After the 2014 General Elections, the BJP leadership had dropped the veterans from the parliamentary board and formed a new committee 'Marg Darshak Mandal' to reinstate them.</p><p>The Bihar mandate - in which the NDA had won only 58 seats in the 243-member house - is being seen by many as a reflection of the 18-month performance of the Narendra Modi government.</p><p>BJP's response</p><p>Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Venkaiah Naidu and Nitin Gadkari issued a statement, saying that "it would certainly welcome any guidance and suggestion of our seniors."</p><p>The statement said, "the party has been very fortunate to have been led by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Shri L.K. Advani for decades. They had set a healthy precedent of the party collectively taking up responsibility for victories and defeats."<br /></p>

<p>After facing humiliating defeat in the Bihar assembly elections, the BJP is under fire from its own senior party men over its poll campaign led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p><p>A day after Patna Sahib MP Shatrughan Sinha questioned the party's wisdom to make excessive use of the prime minister in the state Assembly polls, BJP's Begusarai MP Bhola Singh took exception to the language used by Modi and party president Amit Shah at their rallies during the campaigning.</p><p>Also read: The way ahead for new Bihar and its challenges <br /></p><p>Accusing Modi of injecting communalism instead of talking about Bihar's development in his campaign, Singh said that Modi fell into the trap of RJD president Lalu Prasad by using inappropriate language.</p><p>"People went to Modi looking for a prime minister but they saw a Lalu in him," he said.</p><p>Singh said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, remained dignified attracting voters from different communities.</p><p>Also read: Advani, other veterans speak up on Bihar loss, seek accountability <br /></p><p>"The prime minister fell to Lalu's googly and left his 'Sabka saath sabka Vikas (Development for all)' slogan," he said. "He started speaking in Lalu's language. He began using undignified language while Nitish did not forget decorum even in the battlefield."</p><p>The veteran leader said that the focus of campaign by Modi and Shah should have been Bihar's underdevelopment and its progress. "Instead, the issues of cow and Pakistan were raised," he said.</p><p>The eight-term MLA said that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat should not have a political comment on reservation during a crucial election.</p><p>Singh found ample support from Shatrughan Sinha. "Bhola Babu is a learned man whose views carry weight. We all respect him," he said.</p><p>Shotgun also hit back at party leader Kailash Vijayvargiya who had used a dog analogy to criticise him over his meeting with Nitish and Lalu in Patna on Monday. "People want my reaction to Vijayvargiya's remark.</p><p>My reaction to small or big flies in any party is "Haathi chale Bihar,....bhaunken hazaar," he tweeted on Tuesday.<br /></p>

The mandate Nitish Kumar has got is a reflection of his coalition's reach across votebanks and aspirations.
]]></kicker><body><![CDATA[
<p>With Nitish Kumar being re-elected Bihar chief minister, it is significant to minutely examine the new phase of good governance here. My book Sushasan ke Aaine mein Naya Bihar (Reflections from a well-governed Bihar) had been just published some 5 years ago. Around that time, Nitish Kumar had sai
]]><![CDATA[
d Bihar was an "eatable" that was always falling prey to insects.&nbsp; In such a scenario, do the people give up eating it? And live hungry? No, said Nitish. He said, "You just wipe the insects away with one hand and eat it with the other hand." On the basis of that analogy, obstacles in the way of development can be eradicated. It is clear that on the basis of such intention and commitment only Nitish Kumar was able to take some revolutionary decisions. The Janata darbar and later the Chief Minister at the Janata's darbar, Information Call Centre, the formation of Mahadalit Commission, revamping of Nalanda University, 50 per cent reservation for women in panchayat institutions, cycles and uniforms for schoolgirls, Bihar Special Court Act, the formation of SAP, the strengthening of law and order by the formation of fast track courts are few important examples. The other fact is that Nitish Kumar had governed for a decade too.</p><p>But, this time the 'win' has its own dimensions. Then Nitish Kumar was leading the NDA in Bihar. This time he had contested the election by forming an alliance with Lalu Prasad's RJD and the Congress as the Mahagathbandhan and won spectacularly. That's why the results this time have to be seen and analysed not only from Nitish Kumar's point of view but rather by the Lalu and Congress factors too. This new phase of governance has three significant participants.</p><p>a.) Nitish Kumar was not only the face of development but also social justice. We saw that everybody was convinced with Nitish Kumar's flawless image. People from the remotest areas of Seemanchal and from the flood-affected areas of the Kosi had maintained that the schemes of Nitish Kumar's government like cycle and uniforms distribution has worked and had influenced ground reality. In the same way, women teachers said clearly that they have not seen the Gujrat Model but had clearly seen the works of Nitish Kumar. They all were scared that they would not get the benefits and jobs if Nitish Kumar would not be able to form the government. This way we saw that half the population supported Nitish Kumar. Important fact is that the way Nitish Kumar had brought schemes for Dalit bastis. These had strengthened the image of social justice of Nitish Kumar.</p><p>b.) Where at one end Nitish Kumar's face was influencing Bihar voters, at the other end was Lalu's base, the Muslim-Yadav equation. Starting from day one, Lalu was attracting Yadavs by saying we will bring Mandalraaj and playing on Muslim fears of the BJP. While Nitish was seeking votes by showcasing his work, Lalu was attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah. This is the reason that despite the "jungle raaj" tag, Lalu's party is at the top of this alliance. Today tea vendor Mangal Yadav must be happy on seeing the win of his Sarkar (Lalu Prasad). He must be welcoming everyone to have tea at his cost.</p><p>c.) Third factor is related to the Congress. This election came as a fresh breath for the Congress which had ruled Bihar in the 1980s. This should not be seen just in relation to seats only. Throughout the whole journey, ranging from the ST reserved seat of Manihari to Muslim populated areas of Kishanganj to Bhagalpur to Samastipur, we saw that old Congress supporters (Brahmins and Muslims) found a new enthusiasm for the party. One of the Congress supporters, Amina Khatun of Saudagar Patti, Kishanganj said, "I am an old Congress supporter and have been with Congress since when it had the cow and calf symbol. As long as I live, I will vote for the Congress only." This is the base on the basis of which Congress had governed Bihar and is overall good news for the party's supporters. And for its leaders in Delhi.</p><p>There are challenges too:</p><p>1. Bihar suffers from flood and drought.&nbsp; North Bihar's 76 per cent population is hit by floods. In 2014, the state disaster management department declared 33 of the state's 38 districts drought hit. Floods and drought can destroy governance and progress in Bihar.</p><p>2. Infrastructure development is a big issue for the Nitish government. During my Bihar visit, I found that everyone needs more Bijli, Sadak and Pani&nbsp; along with toilets and good health.</p><p>3. Bihar's jute, flour and sugar industries have been closed for a long. Can we think of a way out for re-industrialising the state?</p><p>4. Unemployment is a challenge with widespread unemployment among youth. A decade ago, migrants were mainly from poor households but today migration is among youngsters from all sections of society.</p><p>5. Education is also a big challenge for good governance. The level of primary education is deteriorating considerably. In higher education, the scarcity of teachers in colleges, delays in academic sessions, poor level of research have become challenges.</p><p>6. Coordination within allies will be problematic for the new government. It would be a challenge for Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar to work together.<br /></p><p>7. Cooperation with the Centre will be also a big challenge for the Nitish government. During Bihar election, the package war between Centre and state came out into the open at a Modi rally.</p><p>(Pankaj Kumar Jha holds a doctorate from the Department of Political Science, Delhi University. He is travelling through Bihar under the Project EECURI&nbsp; led by the London School of Economics &amp; Political Science.)</p>

Bihar election verdict too big to ignore delivery: Shivanand Tiwari

Tiwari, who held key positions in their respective governments in Bihar,
 said it was in Lalu's own interest to let Nitish run Bihar effectively.
]]></kicker><body><![CDATA[
<p>Shivanand Tiwari, who has known Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav for decades, has said it would be a challenge for the 'two strong personalities' to work together, but exuded confidence that 'they would manage just fine'.</p><p>Tiwari, who held key positions in their respective governments in Bihar, said it was in Lalu's own interest to let Nitish run Bihar effectively. "I met Lalu after the verdict. He was very clear. The mandate is too big to ignore delivery," Tiwari said.</p><p>"Both are two different individuals. Differences are only natural. But it is in their interest to sort them out to ensure the new government functions smoothly," he said. Amid a raging national debate on religious intolerance, NDA on Sunday suffered a crushing defeat to a coalition of these two-who joined hands after a decade of bitter rivalry-and Congress.</p><p>The critics of the Grand Alliance say Lalu is in a hurry to pass on his mantle to sons, and-given his alleged track record of caste-driven governance-would not let Nitish continue with his development agenda.</p><p>"Lalu knows it better than anybody else that the longevity of the mantle he wants to pass on depends on the performance of this government. It has to do well, enough to earn a second mandate. It is in Lalu's interest that a government in which his sons are involved does well," Tiwari, in his early 70s, said.</p><p>RJD being the single-largest party in this election, Lalu may want a say in the administration. Nitish will have to offer key portfolios to RJD. The socialist leader, who has been on a break from active politics since 2014, says Lalu has changed. "Portfolio allocation is a routine affair. He is not what he was 10 years ago," he said.</p><p>Nitish and Lalu are both products of the JP movement of the 1970s. When Janata Dal won Bihar in 1990 and Lalu became CM, Nitish was by his side. Nitish parted ways over Lalu's alleged preference to Yadavs in government schemes, and formed a separate outfit in 1994. He ended the 15-year rule of Lalu-Rabri by leading the NDA to victory in 2005. Lalu has now returned to Bihar's centrestage from political wilderness.</p><p>"I'm not saying everything was fine in Lalu's rule. But post-Mandal, Bihar faced a social churning, and upheaval-often branded as jungle raj. See how, despite the corruption taint, Lalu has emerged as a real hero in this election," Tiwari said.</p><p>Nitish grew at the expense of Lalu but left NDA in 2013 when Modi became its prime ministerial candidate. After NDA swept the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, decimating both JD-U and RJD, a helpless Nitish joined forces with Lalu after a gap of two decades. Tiwari was a minister in an RJD government, before joining Nitish's JD-U who made him a Rajya Sabha MP. Lalu declined when Tiwari wanted to return to RJD after being expelled by JDU in 2014 for speaking against Nitish. Tiwari, who now often meets Lalu during morning walks, was a key spokesperson in both governments.</p><p>In June this year, Lalu said 'he was drinking poison' to accept the leadership of Nitish for the Bihar elections. Nitish was the main force behind Lalu's going to jail over corruption charges.</p><p>When in power with BJP, Nitish never allowed a second power centre. With Lalu-a strong CM in the past and the senior partner now-this may not be easy. Also, Kumar likes to go by the rulebook, while Lalu has been more of a maverick.</p><p>Tiwari however says Nitish and Lalu are politically in sync. "These two do bring with themselves a set of contradictions. They are distinct personalities. But I don't see any ideological differences. The differences they have are of temperament, working style. For example, Lalu has not been very disciplined," he said.</p><p>Tiwari also defended the caste spin that the Grand Alliance gave to the Bihar campaign to stall Modi's dream run. "It was a social coalition that weighed heavily in their favour. Caste is the hinge of Bihar politics. Can one deny this?"</p><p>Nitish has returned to power for a third time in Bihar, but this time he has also emerged as a potential nucleus around which an anti-Modi coalition may take shape ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Earlier this year the BJP suffered a drubbing at the hands of Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi.</p><p>In both elections, Modi campaigned fiercely. But soon after the Bihar verdict was out, Lalu indicated he would assume a more national role, leaving Bihar to Nitish?</p><p>"I wouldn't like to read too much into these statements. Just look at the cohesion the two formidable local leaders showed during campaigning. They needed each other to win. They still need each other for Bihar's sake," Tiwari said.</p>

Shatrughan Sinha meets Nitish, BJP leaders call for action

BJP leaders continue to demand action against party MP Shatrughan Sinha for holding the party responsible for the Bihar election debacle.
]]></kicker><body><![CDATA[
<p>Clamour for action against BJP MP and veteran actor Shatrughan Sinha gathered momentum on Monday after the Patna Sahib MP fired fresh salvos against the party leadership while holding them responsible for the Bihar drubbing . The party indicated that action was imminent against the actor.</p><p>Sinha, who embarrassed the party during the Bihar campaign, invited angry barbs from party leaders with controversial BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya even comparing the actor with a dog, who runs after a car believing the vehicle is moving because of him.</p><p>"This party is not dependable on one person, it is a whole organisation and there is a big hierarchy here," said Vijayvargiya using the dog analogy to describe Shatrughan Sinha's conduct .</p><p>He went on to claim that Sinha's identity in politics is because of the BJP and he alone should decide on his loyalty to the party. "Shatrughan Sinha's identity in politics is because of the BJP and the party's identity is not because of him. How loyal he should be towards the party should be decided by him. Causing loss to the party even when you've taken so much from the party is for him to decide. I disagree with his behaviour," he said.</p><p>The Bollywood veteran said that Nitish Kumar was a successful, tried and tested chief minister who was the most respectable after former West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu.</p><p>Shotgun, as Shatrughan is popularly known, said that his meeting with Nitish was a courtesy call and it should not be misconstrued as his defiance of the party. "Even Prime minister Narendra Modi, Union Home minister Rajnath Singh and other senior leaders in the party have congratulated him on his victory," he said.</p><p>The actor- politician continued to provoke the BJP as he met Nitish Kumar to congratulate him on the Grand Alliance's victory. "There should be action against those responsible (for the loss).</p><p>They should be taken to task. As former home secretary and party leader RK Singh has said, responsibility should be fixed and those responsible for this loss should draw lessons even if action is not taken," he told reporters after meeting Kumar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Grand Alliance made history in Bihar Assembly elections by scoring a landslide win over the BJP-led NDA. So, what was the message that the incredible election results from Bihar had sent right across India, asked Karan Thapar on his show To The Point on Monday.</p><p>The three questions he posed:<br /></p><ul><li>Does Bihar prove India is secular because it's 80 per cent Hindu majority is secular and will not allow itself to be divided by beef, religion or innuendos about Pakistan?</li><li>Has Bihar proved correct a slogan from Rajiv Gandhi's time that we would once mimic and deride - 'Mera Bharat Mahaan'?</li><li>Where does the outcome leave Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah? Are they damaged or is that an exaggerated conclusion?</li></ul><br />CPM General Secretary and Rajya Sabha member Sitaram Yechury, former Congress minister and MP Mani Shankar Aiyar, JD(U) Rajya Sabha MP Pavan Varma, BJP national spokesperson Nalin Kohli and well-known columnist Ashok Malik.<p> funfactsThe six big questions <ol><li>What message have the Bihar Assembly polls and its historic results sent out?</li><li>Where does the Bihar verdict leave Amit Shah?</li><li>Is it the defeat of divisive politics?</li><li>Was the Bihar polls caste-driven?</li><li>Will the prime minister accept the blame for Bihar debacle?</li><li>Is the victory in Bihar a boost to Rahul Gandhi's political stand?</li></ol>funfacts <p>"The caste politics, and all other factors people are talking about, were all add-ons on the basic issue that the very character of India cannot be tinkered with or disrupted. This faith of one of the ancient habitations of the world - the Indo-Gangetic plain - has reasserted itself," said Yechury.<br />&nbsp;<br />"I accept the conclusion that Bihar and its people resisted the attempt to polarise the elections, and that was a very persisted attempt made by the BJP, especially in the last three phases of the election. But I would not yet come to the conclusion that all attempts to polarise fail. Hinduism, left to itself, is one of the most eclectic and tolerant religions, a way of life. To try and kill it is to try killing a fly with a sword. The real danger is the attempt to polarise it, and fortunately the people of Bihar this time resisted the attempt to polarise it," said Varma.<br />&nbsp;<br />"Polarisation is a reality in terms of it could be either side. Certainly there were comments that were ill tempered, by some leaders. But to say that was the main script and the electorate has vastly rejected or voted only on that issue will be a tad hasty. We should wait for the final election analysis and we'll find out what is the story. BJP after all did poll the highest numbers of votes for a single largest party - 24 per cent, almost 6 percent ahead of the others.&nbsp; What we did not expect was the votes on the other side would come together so effectively, because in the past elections have showed that it is also about chemistry, and not just arithmetic. Here arithmetic seems to have worked conclusively," said the BJP spokesperson Kohli.<br />&nbsp;<br />"Mera bharat mahaan hi hai [My India is certainly great]. It is clear from the results in Bihar that the insidious attempt at hijacking the idea of India, which is embedded in our constitutional values, has been halted in mid-heist. India has returned to the route on which it was moving ever since the struggle for independence sought to bring all Indians together. Much of the credit of this should go to the 80 percent of our population that considers itself to be Hindu. But, I do not think that secular spirit is limited to the Hindus. The Muslims and other minorities of India are also secular. This country is secular because Indians are secular. There is nothing particularly exclusive about secularism," said Aiyar.</p><p>Watch full debate here:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What could not happen before the Bihar elections seems possible as its aftermath: the creation of a non-BJP front. While leaders of non-BJP parties, essentially those ruling the states and having strong regional appeal, had dabbled with the idea of joining forces with Nitish Kumar-Lalu Prasad-Congress 'Mahagathbandhan' before Bihar polls.</p><p>Buoyed at the massive victory of the Grand Alliance and conversely elated at the second and more consequential drubbing of the Narendra Modi juggernaut in Bihar after Delhi polls, both the leaders seemed looking at playing a larger role now. They expressed that Bihar election results had "national implications". The clarion call has all the possibilities to forge an alternative formed by regional satraps against the BJP.</p><p>Nitish, set to become the chief minister for the third consecutive term, suggested coming together of non-BJP forces at the Centre to provide a strong opposition. "The results have made it clear that people wanted a strong alternative at the national level and have rejected attempts at polarising the society. Bihar results reflect the mood of the nation. It is a milestone election despite an aggressive campaign by the BJP-led NDA and its attempts at polarising the electorate," he said. Kumar also asserted that it was now imperative that they work together to provide a strong alternative.</p><p>Kumar might be looking to become the prime ministerial candidate of such a political pole in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, something he bitterly failed at in 2014. A weak Congress and the badge of having proved conclusively that PM Modi was not invincible could well become Kumar's big ticket.</p><p>Earlier, before Bihar went to the ballot confabulations had remained hot between West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, AAP supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, NCP leadership, SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav of UP and the JD (U) to cobble together what Banerjee had called a non-BJP and non-Left "federal front".</p><p>Some tension could be read between what Lalu said in this context and Nitish's statements. Lalu suggested that while Nitish would handle the state as chief minister, he would embark on a national tour to raise awareness for an alternative to the "communal" BJP.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Following his recent comment on the PM, former union minister Arun Shourie on Sunday again said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and Union minister Arun Jaitley should be held accountable for BJP's loss in Bihar elections and predicted that the silent non-cooperation movement in the party against the leadership will now deepen.</p><p>Also read: Bihar results: List of prominent winners, losers <br /></p><p>He said a Modi-centric campaign lacked credibility because of the unkept promises of the past and blamed BJP's divisive tactics for the drubbing.</p><p>Shourie, a minister in the Vajpayee government, who is no longer with the party, accused Shah and Jaitley of fomenting a coalition against Modi by forcing the other opposition parties, which commanding over 69 per cent of vote, to get into an alliance.</p><p>Also read: Arun Shourie: PM Modi's silence deliberate <br /></p><p>He said that the BJP came to power at the height of Modi's popularity with merely 31 per cent votes.

"There is no fourth person in the party or the government."</p><p>He said a Modi-centric campaign, a divisive campaign and the campaign lacked credibility as promises of the past have not been kept. In this context, he referred to Modi's claim during Lok Sabha poll campaign that everybody will get Rs 15 lakh with the amount of black money he would bring to India if he was voted to power. And then their party president said it was a 'jumla', so people will obviously not take you seriously when you make new promises, he added.</p>

We take the responsibility and sincerely apologise," Roy said on NDTV.</p><p>With different channels showing different trends, there was uproar on the social media. Finally, many stuck to the figures released by the Election Commission of India or Doordarshan till the picture became clear.</p><p>Also read- Bihar verdict: The issue of Bihari vs Bahari settled now, says Shatrughan Sinha </p><p>While NDTV showed that the NDA was ahead in 88 seats as against Grand Alliance in 57 of 150 seats, ABP said the NDA was leading in 75 seats while the Grand alliance was ahead in 70 seats out of 149.</p><p>An exit poll on NDTV channel gave 120 to 130 seats for the NDA and 105 to 115 to the Grand Alliance.

NDA to face tough time in Parliament after defeat in Bihar

NDA's defeat in the Bihar Assembly polls could result in a washed-out winter session of Parliament, scheduled to start this month.
]]></kicker><body><![CDATA[
<p>The growing bitterness between the Congress and the BJP over rising intolerance in the country, the attack on the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru by the saffron party, coupled with NDA's defeat in the Bihar Assembly polls could result in a washed-out winter session of Parliament, scheduled to start this month.</p><p>After the success of the grand alliance in the Bihar polls, the Congress along with its allies JD-U and RJD and the Left parties could together corner the BJPled NDA government which is keen to pass several important bills especially those related to the GST, land acquisition and real estate regulation.</p><p>RJD chief Lalu has already hinted that he would focus more on Delhi to counter BJP and let Nitish manage Bihar. Earlier, the Congress did not allow the government to run Parliament in the budget and monsoon sessions till PM Narendra Modi sacked tainted BJP leaders like External Affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje for helping fugitive Lalit Modi and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for his role in the multicrore Vyapam scam.</p><p>The Congress has already said that it will again seek accountability from the government during the winter session on Sushma lying before the Lok Sabha when she said her ministry had no knowledge of letters written by former finance minister P Chidambaram to UK chancellor of exchequer George Osborne regarding Lalit Modi's deportation. They had also charged the government of being stubborn and averse to taking the opposition on board in passing key legislations. As a result, the GST bill, real estate regulation bill and land acquisition bill remained stuck, putting a break on Modi's economic reforms agenda as he desperately sought foreign capital during his visits abroad.</p><p>Congress is miffed that the government land bill aims to negate the 2013 land takeover act passed by the previous UPA government and has raised objections to it. The party has also decided not to support the government on the national judicial appointments commission. Besides the issue of rising intolerance and pursuance of divisive politics, Congress is also angry with BJP government for trying to dilute the legacy of country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru by renaming schemes under his name and reshaping the Nehru memorial museum and library.</p>
