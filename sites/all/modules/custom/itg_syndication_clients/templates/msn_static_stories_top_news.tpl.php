<![CDATA[
<p>Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday presented his fourth Union Budget in the Lok Sabha and announced a slew of new measures which will affect use of cash in transactions. We take a look at the announcements. <br /></p><ul><li>The minister proposed to ban all cash transactions above Rs 3 lakh beginning April 1, 2017. The decision to ban cash transactions beyond a threshold is based on the recommendation of the Special Investigation Team on black money that was set up by the Supreme Court. The restriction on cash payment comes more than a year after the government made PAN cards mandatory for making purchases above Rs 2 lakh. Hence, the current step may not impact the situation much, say experts.</li><li>The limit for cash payments to be eligible for taxation has been reduced. Any cash payment above ten thousand rupees to a person in a day, shall not be allowed as deduction in computation of Income from "Profits and gains of business or profession". The existing threshold stands at Rs 20,000. </li><li>Any expenditure incurred in a particular year but cash payment made in any subsequent year of a sum exceeding ten thousand rupees to a person in a single day will be deemed as profits and gains of business and profession. </li><li>Further expand the specified mode of payment under respective sub-section of section 40A from an account payee cheque drawn on a bank or account payee bank draft to by an account payee cheque drawn on a bank or account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system through a bank account.</li></ul><p>{}<br /></p><p> </p>

The resources, so raised, will be utilised for airport upgradation,"
 Jaitley said while presenting the budget. Experts said the boost to the

<p>Seeking to make travel between tier-II cities faster, the centre has proposed developing airports in partnership with private players. As part of the regional connectivity plan, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced in the Budget that select airports will be developed and maintained under PPP mode. </p><p>"Airport Authority of India Act will be amended to enable effective monetisation of land assets. The resources, so raised, will be utilised for airport upgradation," Jaitley said while presenting the budget. Experts said the boost to the aviation sector will be crucial for the growth of transport sector. This will also create competition among different modes of transport as it will also prove to be less time consuming. The Civil Aviation Ministry received a substantial increase of over 22 per cent in budgetary allocation at Rs 5,167.60 crore for the next financial year. </p><p>Out of the ministry's total allocation, a good chunk will be for Air India, which is to get Rs 1,800 crore. The amount will be extended to the national carrier as part of the bailout package announced by the then UPA government in 2012. Besides, the airline will be given Rs 508 crore as part of investment in public enterprises. National airports operator AAI has been allocated Rs 2,543 crore, apart from a budgetary support of Rs 100 crore. </p><p>Meanwhile, the budgetary funds for aviation watchdog DGCA has been stepped up significantly to Rs 230.56 crore for 2017- 18. The amount is at Rs 29.67 crore for the current fiscal. Significantly, UN aviation watchdog, International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is scheduled to audit India's air safety preparedness in the second half of this year. </p><p>The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), the country's apex aviation safety agency, has been allocated Rs 214.50 crore in the latest Budget. The government-owned airline has been allocated Rs 1,800 crore as part of the Rs 30,0231 crore financial bailout package. Air India had asked for Rs 2,844 crore as equity from the government for the fiscal year starting April 2017. The airline is surviving on a Rs 30,231-crore bailout package extended by the previous UPA government in 2012, staggering over 10 years. </p><p>{}</p><p>As part of this planned equity infusion, the carrier has so far received around Rs 24,000 crore from the government. Saddled with a debt of Rs 46,570 crore, including Rs 15,900 crore on account of aircraft acquisition, the carrier posted an operational profit of Rs 105 crore for the first time in a decade last fiscal. However, in the ongoing financial year, the airline has reported combined losses of over Rs 700 crore for April and September quarters.</p><p>Meanwhile, the government also allocated Rs 1,840.77 crore to the tourism ministry in the budget for the next fiscal, including Rs 959.91 crore for the Integrated Development of Tourist Circuits around specific themes (Swadesh Darshan scheme). The ministry would be receiving a little over Rs 250 crore more in the 2017-18 fiscal as compared to the ongoing financial year for which it was allocated Rs 1,590.32 crore, according to the budget document. </p><p>Besides, another Rs 100 crore have been allocated for Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD). Significantly, as much as Rs 412 crore have been provided for promotion and publicity of tourism ministry's various programmes and schemes in the Union Budget.</p><p>{}<br /></p>

 developers sitting on completed but unsold homes to revive the sector. <br />

<![CDATA[
<p>Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Union Budget unveiled on Wednesday was like a housewarming party for young professionals as he brought their dream homes within reach and also increased their net pay by halving the tax rate for those with annual incomes up to Rs 5 lakh. </p><p>The government announced infrastructure status for affordable housing to encourage investment in this segment and offered tax sops to developers sitting on completed but unsold homes to revive the sector. At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting completion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income. </p><p>"For builders for whom constructed buildings are stock-intrade, I propose to apply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which completion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for liquidating their inventory," Jaitley said. The measurement norm has been changed to carpet area from built-up area, which will make more spacious homes eligible for the "affordable housing" concessions, Jaitley pointed out. </p><p>{}</p><p>The National Housing Bank will refinance individual home loans of about Rs 20,000 crore in 2017-18, he said in his speech. The government also proposed to relax the condition of period of completion of project for claiming deduction from the current three years to five years, giving builders and buyers more breathing space to organise their finances. </p><p>"We must appreciate the fact that the government is very serious on the mission of housing for all and in the same light we have seen some extremely positive announcements in the budget today. Affordable housing getting infrastructure status will enable efficient supply of housing stock in the country and provide benefits associated with it," said Getamber Anand, national president of CREDAI, apex body of private real estate developers associations. </p><p>In a bid to promote the real estate sector and make it more attractive for investment, Jaitley proposed to reduce the capital gains tax liability on immovable property. Following the grant of infrastructure status, a long-standing demand of realtors, builders will now be eligible for several government incentives, subsidies, tax concessions and institutional funding for low-cost homes. </p><p>"It is positive that the real estate sector has come in the central spectrum of the Union Budget," Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal said. "The real estate sector, which was the hardest hit by demonetisation move, will be one of the major beneficiaries of this budget." With surplus liquidity created by demonetisation, Jaitley said banks have already started cutting lending rates, including those for housing. </p><p>Interest subvention for housing loans has also been announced. Instead of built-up area of 30 and 60 sq metres, the carpet area of 30 and 60 sq metres will now be counted. The 30 sq metre threshold will apply only in case of municipal limits of four metropolitan cities while for the rest of the country, including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq metre will apply. </p><p>Significantly, first home buyers get a deduction for additional interest of Rs 50,000 per annum for loans up to Rs 35 lakh sanctioned during the next financial year, provided the value of the house does not exceed Rs 50 lakh.</p><p>"It is an excellent and balanced Budget. For housing it is an unprecedented Budget," said Rajeev Talwar, CEO of realty major DLF. </p><p>"Infrastructure status to affordable housing will mean cheaper cost of funding and lower tax to developers. Supply of affordable homes will increase, so prices will be lower." </p><p>Tata Housing MD and CEO Brotin Banerjee said, "Easy and dedicated access to institutional financing, higher limit on external commercial borrowings will attract more investments and assure sustained growth of affordable housing in India, making it the core driving segment for real estate. On the other hand, long term financing at lower rates will reduce costs of construction for developers allowing them to pass on benefits to consumers. The new status will increase the resource allocation for the sector, catalysing housing supply and reducing the supply gap."</p><p><a mce_href="http://epaper.mailtoday.in/" target="'_blank'" href="http://epaper.mailtoday.in/">In Association with Mail Today Bureau </a> </p><p>{}</p><p> </p>

<p>To ensure safety of women in the national Capital, the central government has increased the Nirbhaya Fund by almost 90 per cent in the Union Budget 2017-2018. </p><p>In 2016-17, the Delhi Police got Rs 3.4 crore in the Nirbhaya Fund, but the allocation has been increased to Rs 28.9 crore. </p><p>The Nirbhaya Fund was set up in 2013 in the aftermath of the December 16 Delhi gang-rape. This year, Delhi Police were allocated Rs 6,378.18 crore that was earlier Rs 5,913.74 crore. </p><p>The Budget allocation for Delhi Police includes Rs 5,910.28 crore for Delhi Police (maintaining and enforcing law and order in the city), Rs 439 crore for the police infrastructure (office building and residential building projects) and the remaining for the Nirbhaya Fund. </p><p>The Centre has not changed the Budget allocation for the Delhi government and granted Rs 758 crore, while the share in central taxes and duties (that is Rs 325 crore) for the Capital remained unchanged despite AAP government's demand for a hike. </p><p>Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said Delhi has been "deprived" of its due share in central taxes for 17th consecutive year. </p><p>"We had requested the Government of India a number of times to enhance the allocation to at least Rs 5,000 crore as share in central taxes as against Rs 325 crore being released to NCT of Delhi," he said. </p><p>The budget for NCT of Delhi has increased from Rs 8,739 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 46,600 crore in 2016-17, whereas the share in central taxes has remained frozen at Rs 325 crore since 2001-02. </p><p>Also, government of India has not earmarked any fund to local bodies in the NCT. The normal central assistance to NCT of Delhi during 2017-18 has been proposed at Rs 412.99 crore which is at the same level of current year 2016-17. </p><p>There is no increase in the Normal Central Assistance in the year 2017-18. </p><p>{}</p><p>"The Government of NCT of Delhi has already paid about Rs 96 crore as enhanced compensation to 1984 riot victims in the current year. However, in the Union Budget, an amount of Rs 75 crore in the current year RE and Rs 15 crore in the next year BE has been proposed for reimbursement to GNCTD," said Sisodia. </p><p>An amount of Rs 5 crore as grant has been proposed for GNCTD towards Disaster Response Fund which is at the same level of Rs 5 crore in the current year. </p><p>Meanwhile, Rs 17,810 crore has been allotted for the Metro projects under the ministry of urban development across the country. It includes Rs 2,700.01 crore for the equity investment, Rs 1,465.99 crore for subordinate debt, Rs 13,644 crore for Pass Through Assistance (PTA). </p><p>Of Rs 17,810 crore, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will also get the allocation. Whereas, Rs 150 crore has been granted to DMRC for NCR expansion. For Phase III sanctioned fund, Rs 42,674.91 crore (including all taxes, extension in Noida, Ballabhgarh) has been given.</p><p>{}<br /></p>

<p>Hungry for jobs perennially, millennials tried to wrap their head around Union budget as finance minister delivered what government has in store for them. Not only will the financial assistance from government to the ministry of Skill and Development help the students across the country with more scholarships, it will also hone the youth ready to enter the job market, experts told MAIL TODAY. </p><p>"Under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, our target is to skill one crore people in the youth sector.

<p>Just before some time from the elections in five states, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley defended his move in Budget 2017-18 over political funding. Jaitley said, "The cash limit of above Rs 2,000 for political funding is on recommendation of the Election Commission, which is a credible institution". </p><p>Stressing the need for greater transparency in political funding, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the maximum amount of cash donation by an individual to a political party could be Rs 2,000 -- a sharp drop from the Rs 20,000 amount in cash earlier.</p><p>Presenting the Union Budget for 2017-18, Jaitley said political parties can take donations from donors through cheque and digital payments.</p><p>He also gave a stern warning and said, "If someone misuses the Rs 2,000 upper limit for political funding, then the act will have its consequences".</p><p>{}</p><p>Commenting over the idea of Universal Basic Income, he said, "It's a wonderful idea. But first, Indian politics needs to reach at a mature level to implement it."</p><p>{}</p><p>The Finance Minister also appreciated the Chief Economic Advisor, Arvind Subramanian, for his UBI suggestion in the Economic Survey. </p><p>{}</p><p>{}</p><p>He said,"To implement Universal Basic Income, Political Parties must appreciate that it's better alternative for poverty elimination".</p><p>{}</p><p>"We have mostly an unstructured and untargeted subsidy regime in India. Many subsidies like fertiliser are used more by the rich people. So it is better to select 30-35% most vulnerable persons and give a cheque in their hand to lift them out of poverty", the Finance Minister said. </p><p> </p>
