<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Chandigarh, Jun 1 (PTI) Haryana government today decided to launch a scheme -- Swarnim Suraksha Yojna -- to transfer insurance premium of Rs 12 directly to the bank account of beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna (PMSBY). </p><p>This decision was taken in a meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar here today. </p><p>Under this scheme, which would be effective from today, all beneficiaries in the state would get accidental cover of Rs 2 lakh. This scheme, under which expenditure of about Rs 19 crore would be incurred, would benefit 1.56 crore persons, an official release said.      Under this scheme, Haryana government would provide benefit of PMSBY to people belonging to all sections of the society. Persons in the age group of 18 to 70 years would be eligible to get Rs 12 from the State Government in their Aadhaar-linked ?Jan-Dhan? bank account. </p><p>For availing benefit under the scheme, all citizens will have to take one-time membership through Aadhaar-linked Jan Dhan Account in PMSBY. </p><p>Subsequently, state government as per the information received from banks, would credit Rs 12 into their account without any application. </p><p>The scheme would provide insurance benefit of Rs 2 lakh for accidental death or full disability. </p><p>It was also decided in the meeting that the heads of poor families would be covered under the complete insurance scheme. Under this, State government would deposit premium of Rs 330 for head of Below Poverty Line (BPL) families in the age group of 18 to 50 years. </p><p>This would provide insurance benefit of Rs 2 lakh on account of accidental or other death to their families under Pradhan Mantri Jivan Jyoti Bima Yojna (PMJJBY). </p><p>This scheme would benefit 12.33 lakh heads of BPL families at a cost of Rs 40.69 crore. Under this scheme, the amount would be transferred directly into the bank account of BPL beneficiaries. </p><p>It was also decided in the meeting that heads of BPL families which are covered under PMJJBY could also take benefit of PMSBY. The families of such persons would get insurance amount of Rs 4 lakh on account of accidental death of the head of family and Rs 2 lakh on account of natural death. </p><p>Both these schemes would be linked with single Jan-Dhan bank account. In case, a person has Rupay Card of Jan-Dhan scheme, his or her family would be eligible to get additional insurance claim of Rs 1 lakh, bringing the total claim to Rs 5 lakh.
