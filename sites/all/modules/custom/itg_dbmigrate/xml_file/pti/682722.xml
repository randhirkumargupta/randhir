<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Meanwhile, opposition National Conference (NC) raised the issue of implementation of various proposals made in the budget in Legislative Council also, saying there was no fun in having a discussion on the budget in the House if they have already been put into effect. </p><p>"The government has implemented the proposals made in the budget and also issued orders in this regard. When it has happened, then there is no fun in having discussions on the budget. What is the aim of these discussions in both the Houses then?" NC MLC Ali Mohammad Dar said. </p><p>He was speaking on the general discussion over the budget for the year 2016-17 presented in the state legislature on May 30. </p><p>Dar said the budget neither focuses on daily wage workers and nor does it talk about panchayati institutions and the rehabilitation of flood affected people in the state. </p><p>"There is no focus on daily wagers, on how to regularise their services. They are still getting meager daily wages of Rs 150. I request the government that till their services are regularised, their wages be increased. </p><p>"Similarly, there should be an increase in the salary of panchayat members," he said. </p><p>He said if there was a need to implement 7th Pay Commission in other states, why cannot it be implemented in Jammu and Kashmir. </p><p>Dars party colleague Sajad Kichloo termed the budget as "directionless and visionless". </p><p>Congress MLC Naresh Gupta said the government needs to take "practical approach" to resolve the issues of daily wagers and contractual employees. </p><p>"The budget does not mention what policies the government will take to fight unemployment in the state. The finance minister has taken money from one pocket and put it in another. This is a futile exercise," he alleged. </p><p>Terming the budget as "balanced", ruling PDP MLC Zafar Iqbal Manhas said it would help in taking the state forward on the path of development. </p><p>There are many programmes to fight unemployment especially the new initiatives in private sector and enhancing entrepreneurship, Manhas said. </p><p>He, however, said the finance minister should focus on electrifying those villages where there is still no power. </p><p>Also, there is no mention about Paharis in the budget. They should be empowered economically and cannot be neglected, he said. </p><p>Terming the budget as "objective", BJP legislator Ramesh Arora said the finance minister has dared to talk about negativity in certain areas. He first pointed out irregularities and then offered solutions to them, he said. </p><p>However, he suggested the government should amend those proposals in the budget which could "pinch a common man". </p><p>There is a tax of Rs 50 per connection per month on cable TV, that should be removed. Mobile phones and i-pads, which are a need these days, should be removed from the D-1 list, he said. </p><p>Arora also said there was a need to further improve the working condition of police in the state and VAT on CSD items should be totally removed.
