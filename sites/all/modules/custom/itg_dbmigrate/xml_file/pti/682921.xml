<storybody><![CDATA[<p>"These may be smaller steps than a major outcome in the</p><p>"These may be smaller steps than a major outcome in the WTO. And they are not easy steps either. These are complex negotiations with many parts and many interests to consider ? which is why our ambitions on timelines for completion are not always met," the Australian High Commissioner said, adding "But they take us in the right direction". </p><p>The High Commissioner said they can be thought of as planks in a bridge that is constructed over time. </p><p>The pacts are kind of a bridge to carry both the countries to a world with increasingly lower barriers to international economic activity, Sidhu said. </p><p>When asked whether there is a link between RCEP and CECA, she said both the pacts are complementary to each other. </p><p>She said the bottomline is this that the RCEP is a regional agreement and putting all the member countries on common footing in terms of things like tariffs and reducing non-tax barriers. </p><p>But, she said CECA has more range, scope and specificity. </p><p>Replying to a question about Indias entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), she said it will be a good thing for both India and APEC. </p><p>However she said: "all of this is caveatted by the fact that there is a membership freeze in APEC at the moment". </p><p>But the the Australian governments view is that it will be a good thing for India to join APEC. </p><p>The benefit for India to become its member includes access and ability to be in conversation with whole bunch of countries and tacking issues about simplifying economic processes and streamlining economies. </p><p>She added that "I am not aware of a membership price that has to be paid, I am not aware that to join APEC, you need to commit to certain trade reductions. As far as I know that is not the case". </p><p>"We would welcome Indias participation in APEC," she said. </p><p>Further she said almost half a million, out of a total Australian population of 24 million, are of Indian origin. </p><p>There are 53,000 Indian students studying in Australia today, the second largest source of overseas students in that country. And 2,33,000 Indians visited Australia in 2015, making India its eighth largest source of visitors.  </p><p>Trade and investment between Australia and India now spans a wide range of industries, products and services ? from mineral and energy commodities, to sophisticated manufactured goods; from large-scale business services and skills training, to niche products in many different sectors. </p><p>"But, on the economic front, I have to say there is also a lot of unfulfilled potential in the relationship too. </p><p>"One comparison that a number of observers have made is that, while Australias two-way trade with India is at 18 billion Australian dollar (A$), it is barely more than one-tenth of our two way trade with China, which stands at A$ 150 billion," she said.
