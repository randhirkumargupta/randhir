<storybody><![CDATA[<p>From Aditi Khanna </p><p>London, Jun 1 (PTI) Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who underwent an open-heart surgery here yesterday, is "happy and healthy" and soon will be able to receive visitors beyond family members, a party official said today. </p><p>The 66-year-old PML-N leader is "resting and recovering" with his family members by his side at The Harley Street Clinic in central London. </p><p>"Everything has gone well, the operation was successful and he is stable, resting and recovering. He is happy and healthy," said a PML-N UK spokesperson. </p><p>The spokesperson also said that Sharif will be moved to another room in the clinic tomorrow to be able to receive visitors beyond family members. </p><p>"When he had come to London for his check-up in April, he had been advised by doctors to not undertake any air travel. But he wanted to go back to Pakistan. We were aware back then that another check-up and even surgery may be necessary," the spokesperson said. </p><p>Sharif had arrived in London on May 22 and went in for the surgery yesterday, his second cardiac procedure in five years. </p><p>Sharifs daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who accompanied him to the UK, had been providing updates on social media. </p><p>"All arteries successfully grafted... Surgery successful by The Grace Of Almighty," she had tweeted yesterday. </p><p>Her last tweet after the surgery concluded read: "My father... the LOVE of my life... Allah bless you with a long life & perfect health... Ameen." </p><p>Sharif is expected to stay at the clinic for a week and his date of return to Pakistan will be decided based on doctors advice. </p><p>Earlier reports had indicated the surgery would take place at the Princess Grace Hospital in London but it took place at The Harley Street Clinic, one of the UKs well-known private hospitals just off Londons Harley Street - famous for medical specialists.
