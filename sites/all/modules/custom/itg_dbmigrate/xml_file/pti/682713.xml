<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Jaitley said the Indian economy clocked 7 per cent growth</p><p>Jaitley said the Indian economy clocked 7 per cent growth rate in every quarter of the last fiscal, ended March 31, despite an unsupportive global economy and two consecutive years of weak monsoon. </p><p>This has been possible because of increased public spending, performance of Indias private sector and confidence which foreign investors reposed in India by investing the highest ever funds even in the slowdown years, he said. </p><p>"Im sure Japanese investors and funds and other agencies who are looking forward for gainfully employing their resources would certainly look at the India story which offers attractive destination for investment," he added. </p><p>He said that besides infrastructure, the manufacturing sector is the top most priority and provides very large opportunity to international investors to participate in India growth story. </p><p>India offers flexibility to investors, Jaitley said, adding that impetus on Make in India, increased infrastructure and rural spending would help push growth. </p><p>"The returns that India offer are extremely attractive compared to other destinations, the magnitude and volume of investment required is much larger and its for a reasonable period of time that this investment is going to continue because infrastructure deficit has to be met," Jaitley added. </p><p>The Finance Minister said the Indian government is now continuing on the reform trajectory which was left undone in 1991 and people have become aspirational and are supporting reforms. </p><p>"India today is passing through a very critical phase in its history. In 1991 we had a very important reform programme which was initiated. It proved to be very successful. We continued on that roadmap and I think what was left out is now being implemented. There is never a last day in the calendar of reforms, situations are dynamic, they keep changing, they keep progressing. Newer challenges come up and we expect newer responses from the government," he said. </p><p>He said Japanese companies have become household names in India starting from automobiles to household appliances to also the Delhi Metro. </p><p>"Our industrial corridors are being built with Japanese assistance and I am sure the ambitious Bullet Train project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad once implemented will be absolutely a showpiece in Indias economic development," he said, adding currently there are over 50 projects of different magnitudes being implemented in India today. </p><p>"I dont see a period which is very far off where almost every major city in India that aspires to have a local transport system based on Delhi Metro...to become reality," Jaitley added.
