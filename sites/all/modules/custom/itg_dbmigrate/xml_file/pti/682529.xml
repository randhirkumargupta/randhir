<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) A court here has held a Delhi police official guilty of demanding and accepting Rs 10,000 bribe from a person for releasing his impounded car. </p><p>Special CBI Judge Brijesh Kumar Garg convicted head constable Dev Raj under Prevention of Corruption Act for accepting bribe from complainant Narinder Singh in 2013 as a favour to release his Santro car which was being driven by his friend when it was impounded in a traffic violation case. </p><p>The court, while holding Raj guilty, relied on electronic evidence and testimonies of the complainant as well as CBI officers who had laid a trap to catch him red-handed. </p><p>"The prosecution has successfully proved, beyond a shadow of doubt, by oral as well as corroborative�electronic�and forensic�evidence�that the�accused (Raj) has�demanded and accepted�a bribe�of�Rs 10,000�from�the complainant for releasing�his�car... </p><p>"In�the�present�case,�the�accused�has failed�to�present� any�plausible�or�reasonable�defence�to�rebut�the presumption� and�to�prove�his�innocence.�No�material�evidence has been produced on record in his defence..." the court, which is yet to pronounce the quantum of sentence, said. </p><p>According to prosecution, on August 20, 2013,�Singhs car, which was being driven by his friend, was seized by traffic police and was deposited at Kanjhawala�police station here after a quarrel took place between Singhs friend and police. </p><p>In his complaint, lodged on September 2, 2013, Singh alleged that when�he�met�head�constable�Dev�Raj�in�the police�station,�he�was asked to bring money to get the car released. </p><p>Singh then approached the CBI officials, who laid a trap to catch the accused cop red-handed. </p><p>During the trial, the cop had denied the allegations and contended that he was falsely implicated. </p><p>The court, however, rejected his contention and said, "the clinching�electronic�evidence, in�the form�of�recorded� conversations�between�the�accused�and the complainant�has� corroborated�the�prosecution�case�and�has ruled�out�any� inference�of�false�implication�of�accused."
