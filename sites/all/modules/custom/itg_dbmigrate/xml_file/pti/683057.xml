<storybody><![CDATA[<p>awards      Bharuch, Jun 1 (PTI) Citing the forensic report claiming that meat found at the house of Mohammad Akhlaq was of "cow or its progeny", VHP today demanded apology from the Uttar Pradesh government, Bollywood actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and all those who had returned awards in the fallout of the Dadri lynching incident. </p><p>"UP government intentionally suppressed the forensic report for six months. UP government kept saying that beef was not found at Akhlaqs house. But, finally the truth has been revealed," senior VHP leader Surendra Jain here claimed. </p><p>"The entire episode was used as a tool to portray Hindus and Hindu organisations in bad light. Entire Hindu community had been labelled as intolerant. Now we demand that UP government should tender an apology for defaming and tormenting the Hindus on this issue," Jain alleged. </p><p>He also accused the Akhilesh Yadav-led government of "going soft" on Muslim outfits.      "UP government has become a communal government....They take no action against those who issue anti-national fatwas, who attack Hindu processions during Ram Navmi or those who support and encourage terrorist activities," Jain furhter alleged. </p><p>"Due to such approach of the UP government, Hindus feel as if they are second-class citizens. </p><p>"The people who returned their awards must also apologise or at least accept that they did it as a part of a conspiracy to portray Indian Hindus as intolerant," he claimed. </p><p>He also attacked Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan over the issue. "As a part of the conspiracy, Shah Rukh and Aamir Khan, who were given so much love by Hindus, have said India has become intolerant. Now time has come for you to tender an apology to Hindus....If you dont, Hindus will have to think about you," Jain said. PTI CORR PJT KRK KND</p>]]></storybody>
