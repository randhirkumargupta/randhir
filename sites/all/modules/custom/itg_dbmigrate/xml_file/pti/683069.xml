<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Kurukshetra, June 1 (PTI) BJP MP Raj Kumar Saini, who has been in the dock over his alleged anti-Jat rants, today hit out at the Prakash Singh Committee report which probed Februarys mayhem in Haryana and said he would quit politics if it was proved that the violence was a result of his comments.  </p><p>Addressing media persons at his residence here, the MP from Kurukshetra who had earlier been issued a showcause notice by his party BJP for his alleged anti-Jat rants, said his name in the report has been mentioned wrongly. </p><p>"I challenge that if anybody can prove that the violence or agitation by Jats was the result of my statements and comments, I will not only resign as MP but also leave politics," Saini said reacting sharply to his name figuring in the Prakash Singh Committee report for allegedly instigating violence during the Jat quota stir.      Referring to media reports that some ministers of particular community tried to influence Parkash Singh report, Saini said that "report seems to have been written under the influence of these persons".      He said that Parkash Singh should have taken his views also before mentioning his name in the report.      To a question, he warned that next time people would not wait for government?s action and would themselves tackle the people indulging into any act of violence.      He said he has not done anything wrong for which he should be afraid of.      He alleged that the leaders of the pre-dominant (Jat) community who are facing various criminal charges including sedition "are meeting Chief Minister and Ministers openly but police not only avoid arresting them."      Saini said he is not a "ghulam" (slave), but a BJP worker, and he would continue to fight for the poor and downtrodden.      He said that if raising voice in favour of downtrodden is wrong then there is no use to remain in politics. PTI Cor SUN  AKK</p>]]></storybody>
