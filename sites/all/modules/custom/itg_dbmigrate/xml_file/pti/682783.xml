<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) Triggering a fresh confrontation, the Anti-Corruption Bureau today began a probe into AAP governments ambitious app-based bus service scheme which was red-flagged by the Lt governor on the ground that his approval was not taken before its launch. </p><p>Lt Governor-appointed ACB chief M K Meena ordered an inquiry into the scheme on the basis of a complaint filed by BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, who alleged that the Kejriwal government was wanted to launch the scheme to benefit a Gurgaon based private bus aggregator. </p><p>A senior Delhi government official involved in the finalisation of the scheme, said a conspiracy is being "hatched" to delay the rollout of the unique initiative under which people would have been able to book seats using smart phones. </p><p>"There are allegations that no prior approval of Lt Governor was sought before launch of the scheme and that it was aimed at benefiting a private company," said Meena who had a series of confrontations with the AAP government. </p><p>The Delhi government had issued a notification on May 20 to roll out the premium bus service scheme from today but the Lt governor last week said it cannot be launched as his prior approval had not been obtained. </p><p>The notification, signed by Delhi Transport Commissioner Sanjay Kumar, had created an impression that it was issued following approval from Lt Governor Najeeb Jung. </p><p>The Delhi government official said the registration process of buses under the scheme could not start as Jung had asked it to review the scheme. </p><p>Citing media reports Gupta said in his complaint that the Lt Governors office had clarified on May 28 that no "approval" was given by him for the service. </p><p>"It calls for a criminal probe into how the AAP government under the signature of Secretary-cum-Commissioner (Transport) could misuse Lt Governors name in this manner," he said. </p><p>The Leader of Opposition alleged the AAP government "seems to be in extraordinary hurry to approve the Premium Bus Service Scheme and the procedure adopted leaves many questions unanswered."
