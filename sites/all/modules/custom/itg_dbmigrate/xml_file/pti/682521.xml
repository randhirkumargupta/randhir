<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) Eyeing the Delhi University students union elections which are conducted few weeks after freshers join college, student wings of various political parties have set up their help desks to assist the undergraduate admission seekers. </p><p>Admissions to over 60,000 seats in various undergraduate courses offered by 63 DU colleges began today. Though the process has been made entirely online reducing the need for candidates to visit the university or respective colleges, these student outfits have set up their help desks to assist those who land up at the campus. </p><p>Among those who have set up these desks include Congress affiliated National Students Union of India (NSUI), BJPs student wing Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad and AAPs Chatra Yuva (CYSS). </p><p>While the DUSU poll battle has traditionally been between NSUI and ABVP, CYSS had contested its first student union election last year but had failed to open its account. All four seats were swept by ABVP. </p><p>"We have been setting up help desks in previous years too. Then it used to be for offline applications to help the candidates with what documents need to be submitted, to counsel them about colleges and courses and much more," a NSUI member said. </p><p>A member at the CYSS help desk said, "the help desks are even more important now as there are so many aspirants from poor families who do not have access to internet and computer to complete the tedious application process. It was unfair of university authorities to not think of them before going ahead with such a process". PTI GJS RG</p>]]></storybody>
