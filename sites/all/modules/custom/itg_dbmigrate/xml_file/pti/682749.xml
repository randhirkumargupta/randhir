<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, June 1 (PTI) Two persons were allegedly injured in a scuffle between a group of people and bouncers at a prominent pub in south Delhis Hauz Khas area, police said today. </p><p>Police have received complaint in connection with the matter but an FIR is yet to be registered. </p><p>The group of people comprising marketing executives have alleged the bouncers at the pub assaulted them and misbehaved with a woman following an argument over stopping two of them from carrying liquor outside the premises. </p><p>The incident took place on the wee hours of Saturday when the group of seven marketing and advertising professionals, including three women, had gone for dinner at the Bandstand pub in Hauz Khas area, said Sushant Kaistha, the complainant. </p><p>Around 12.30 AM when the bar closed down, two of them went near the main entrance with their drinks. But they were stop there as guests are not allowed to carry alcohol outside the restaurant premises. </p><p>So the two started finishing their drinks standing at the staircase. Meanwhile, the two bouncers manning the main entrance asked them to hurry and when they responded casually, one of the boouncer allegedly slapped a marketing executive, claimed a woman who was part of the group. </p><p>"They took out sticks and started hitting two of my friends. They punched and thrashed them for no reason, while the pub management only fuelled the violence rather than stopping the bouncers," she alleged. </p><p>The group also alleged that there were police officials who arrived at the spot but did not help them. </p><p>"We went to a private hospital for treatment and on seeing our injuries, they recommended a medico-legal counselling, the report of which we have submitted to the police," Kaistha said. </p><p>"The police came to my residence the next day and enquired about the incident. We lodged the complaint and met senior officials of the district, who have assured us of strict action," he said. </p><p>Manager of the pub, J S Rawat, said the two members of the group who were carrying beer bottles were stopped at the main gate in adherence to law, but he refuted the allegations about assaulting with sticks and misbehaving with any woman, adding it was a pub staff who called up the police after the incident. </p><p>He also claimed that one of the guests might have sustained injury after a bouncer acted in "self defence" and another guest fell of from a stair losing balance during the argument and twisted his ankle. </p><p>"A complaint has been received in connection with the matter and we are looking into it. We are awaiting the second medical opinion on the injuries of one of the complainants," a senior police official said. PTI DEY VIT RCJ RG RCJ</p>]]></storybody>
