<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Chennai, Jun 1 (PTI) The Madras High Court Advocates Association and Women Lawyers Association would hold a rally here on June 6 to protest against the amendments made to existing rules under the Advocates Act. </p><p>The high court had recently issued a notification making amendments to existing rules under the Advocates Act with a view to ensure peaceful conduct of court proceedings and suggesting disciplinary action to be taken against erring advocates. </p><p>A notification issued by the Registrar General of the high court said, "In exercise of powers conferred by Section 34(1) of Advocates Act, the court makes the following amendments to the existing rules. The amendments shall come into force with effect from the date of publication." </p><p>It said the court has power under 14-A of Advocates Act to debar advocates who indulge in activities such as trying to influence a judge or participates in a procession inside court campus or holds placards inside the court hall, among others. </p><p>Such advocates shall be debarred from appearing before the high court or subordinate courts permanently or for such period as the court may think fit and the Registrar General shall thereupon report it to the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu, it said. </p><p>A decision to hold protest rally on June 6 was taken by the respective associations at their general body meetings. </p><p>The MHAA also requested the Chief Justice and other judges to withdraw the amendments immediately. </p><p>Opposing the amendments, the MHAA requested the Chief Justice to call for a dialogue between the bar and the bench and evolve effective mechanisms to identify the key issues hampering the effective functioning of the judiciary and prepare both short and long term plans and programmes to amicably settle all the issues.
