Also an average Goan is very experimental in palate," Linda said. </p><p>Asked how has the Goan food evolved over a period of time, Atul Shah of Mapusa-based Spice Goa said, the state predominantly has been influenced by three cultures - the Christian /Hindu/Muslim - each having played a great part in influencing the food which is distinct to Goan cuisine. </p><p>"The distinct feature differentiating the Hindu and Muslim cuisine to Christian food was the use of local toddy vinegar, which is predominantly used in Christian cuisine, but not in Hindu or Muslim food who use tamarind or the kokum to add the tangy flavour their food," he said. </p><p>Giving a similar take on the topic, Mascarenhas said that every conquest over the years has created a new aspect where Goan food in concerned. </p><p>"The only constant is the fish. From the 6th century BC with the advent of the Saraswat Brahmins, where fresh local ingredients were of paramount importance with regards to health and ayurveda," she said. </p><p>"The conquests of the Hindu Kings gave birth to the Sukhems (a Konkan styled preparation), Muslims adapted to coconut in their preparations, The Portuguese brought in Vinailho, sarapatel and many other dishes which the locals after conversion to suit their palate added spice to make the famous Vindalho and Sorpotel," the food critic revealed. </p><p>Shah said over the years, on account of non- availability, many ingredients have been substituted or have been deviated in the use of the preparations. </p><p>"Spices like the tarvati mirsang (similar to the birds eye chilli) are being substituted by either badgi or Kashmiri variety. The local Goan chilli called kankon chilli used for the fish curry is being substituted by either Kashmiri or badgi chilli," he said. </p><p>When asked how have the tourists influenced Goan food, Mascarenhas said, "I would not say they have influenced in any way, although during the time of the foreign visitors food was adapted to suit their palate...squid butter garlic, etc. </p><p>"Today many tourists foreigners and Indians alike opt for Goan preparations although Goa has some of the best chefs around cater to every palate...Greek, Pan Asian, Gujarati and now even Modern Australian...besides the old favourites. </p><p>"At one time there were only a handful of Goan restaurants in the state. Perhaps because of the tourists who were mostly foreigners. But today the preparations are found in nearly 75 per cent of the restaurants. So its popularity is definitely growing," she added.
