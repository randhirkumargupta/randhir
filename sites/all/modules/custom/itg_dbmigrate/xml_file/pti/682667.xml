<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) The Central Information Commission has reserved its order on declaring Aam Admi Party and its legislative party as a public authority bringing it under the ambit of the Right to Information Act. </p><p>Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said the order "on question whether Aam Admi Party and its Legislative Party is public authority under RTI Act is reserved, until the threeï¿½Commissioner Bench of CIC decides the issues before it about political parties and RTI". </p><p>CIC is hearing a complaint against six political parties for not complying with the provisions of RTI Act. </p><p>During the hearing related to plea filed by Neeraj Saxena who sought voter card related records of Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal, Acharyulu sought submissions from the Delhi Chief Minister and his party. </p><p>In his submissions, Kejriwal stated he had no objection for disclosure of information about him as available in public records. </p><p>"The Commission finds that his written submission is silent on following questions, (a) why not an elected legislator be considered as public authority under RTI Act, (b) why not the legislator party of AAP be considered as public authority. </p><p>"(c) why not CIC direct Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, in his capacity as a legislator, considering him as public authority under RTI to provide information/reply to the RTI application of the appellant, who is alleging that he claimed to register his vote in Delhi, without being resident of Delhi," Acharyulu noted. </p><p>He gave one more opportunity to him to present his views. </p><p>"The Counsel for Arvind Kejrival has represented that they have nothing specific to say anything on that point and would welcome whatever decision the Commission would possibly arrive at according to law," he said.
