<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Mumbai, Jun 1 (PTI) The key advise given by Australian pace legend Jeff Thomson to young Mumbai pacer Shardul Thakur, who has been picked in the 17-man Test touring party to the West Indies, is to maintain unbridled aggression as a bowler. </p><p>"He (Thomson) told me to be aggressive in bowling, especially when I am not getting wickets," said Thakur here today on the sidelines of the MCA-IDBI Federal Life Insurance Bowling Foundations media conference. </p><p>Thakur said Thomson told him, "Try to get wickets, thats how you will test your character. Be aggressive in your mind to get a batsman out. </p><p>"He has told me a few things. I have been busy playing a lot of matches in the domestic season, but did not get much time to practise with him. Whenever I met him he spoke about his experience and shared a few things. He asked me to continue to do the things I have done in the past," said the 24-year-old bowler. </p><p>Thakur, who grabbed 41 wickets for Mumbai during its 41st title-triumph in Ranji Trophy in the season gone by after grabbing 48 wickets in the previous season, said even bowling defensively can be termed aggressive bowling under certain conditions. </p><p>"Sometimes bowling defensively also is bowling aggressively. It depends on the conditions," he elaborated. </p><p>For the Windies tour scheduled in July-August, Thakur has already started his fitness training. </p><p>"Now I have started my fitness training and soon I will be bowling - in a week or so. There are a few things on my mind. I have to follow basics correctly. That has helped me a lot." </p><p>He has not spoken, as yet, to current or former players about the conditions he would encounter in the Caribbean. </p><p>"I have not spoken to anyone. When I go there and when the team sits together, I will speak to the senior fast bowlers," he said. PTI SSR NRB BS BS BAS</p>]]></storybody>
