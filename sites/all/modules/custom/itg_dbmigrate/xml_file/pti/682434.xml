<storybody><![CDATA[<p>"He was very close to my father (Jagmohan Dalmiya) who     "He was very close to my father (Jagmohan Dalmiya) who loved him a lot. They formed a close team and worked in tandem. He had also offered his serviceS in Dhaka (in 1998). Its a sad day for Bengal cricket," Avishek added.      No cricket curator has been in the news like Mukherjee who stood firm on his principles, be it against the most successful Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni or former English captain-turned-commentator Michael Atherton.      Mukherjee had turned down Dhonis request for a square turner against England in December 2012 and instead prepared a good cricket pitch which had bounce from day one.      England went on to win the Test by seven wickets en route to a 2-1 series win.      He did not stop there as he spoke at length to the media and went on sick leave in protest.      During the same series, he once again made headlines when he shooed away English broadcaster Atherton from taking a close look at the pitch and in a firm voice had said, "Please go", a move which was supported by the CAB.      Mukherjee had lost his daughter a few years back and within months his wife passed away but such was his unflinching commitment towards his state association that within days he was back to prepare pitches for the CAB knockout matches.      A fast bowler, who was also a football goalkeeper in the 1940s, Mukherjee became involved with cricket in 1952 after his playing days ended following a road accident.      He started out from the Suburban Club before being elected the secretary of Bengal National Railways Club in 1964, CAB veteran and stadium committee chairman Chitrak Mitra recollected.      Kartik Bose, the then chief coach of the CAB, had introduced him to pitch-making as he was in-charge of the 1987 World Cup final wicket.      He returned to the Eden after Jagmohan Dalmiya brought him back after the infamous World Cup semifinal in 1996. PTI TAP SSC SSC</p>]]></storybody>
