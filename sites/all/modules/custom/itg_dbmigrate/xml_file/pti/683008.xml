He has presented a package that brings us close together and the one we want to work with the Prime Minister in dealing with that," he added. </p><p>Cardin, however, denied that raising this issue will have any impact on Prime Ministers visit to the US. </p><p>Ruling out that by raising these issues of corruption and religious tolerance could hamper the relations between the two countries, Cardin said, "its in context to which the relationship is only getting stronger between the two democratic countries." </p><p>Raising the issue of corruption, he said, "In the 2015 Human Rights Report, officials frequently engage in corrupt practices with impunity and corruption was present at all levels of the government and this should be unacceptable to the people living in India and it cannot be allowed to continue in a democratic country." </p><p>Cardin said that Modi has "acknowledged" the challenges he has in his own country about corruption and has taken steps to deal with these issues. </p><p>Noting that a strong economic foundation in India will allow a greater capacity to deal with some of the human rights challenges, he said this will help in providing sanitation and drinking water facilities to a number of families in the country.
