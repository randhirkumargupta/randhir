<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Itanagar, Jun 1 (PTI) To fast track all projects in Arunachal Pradesh, the Niti Aayog has decided to convene a review meeting every three months with the state government to speed up development. </p><p>"Our sole objective is to resolve all the pending projects in the state and accordingly state chief secretary has submitted a list of all pending projects," Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant told reporters here last night. </p><p>The Niti Aayog will convene a review meeting every three months with the state government to speed up development, he said. </p><p>Kant, leading a 13-member all ministries Niti Aayog team, arrived here yesterday and held discussions with Chief Minister Kalikho Pul, Deputy Chief Minister Kameng Dolo besides, high-ranking state government officials. </p><p>"As per Prime Ministers directive, the team is here to help the chief minister to bring development in the land-locked state," Kant said, adding the team had fruitful interactions with the state government pertaining to several vital issues, including police modernisation. </p><p>The Aayog also identified few areas like organic, orchid farming and horticulture where the state has vast scope. </p><p>Kant said, the state has potentials in tourism, organic farming, floriculture and horticulture but areas like road communication, health and education sector have to be improved upon. </p><p>"We will work in partnership with the state government to bring development of Arunachal at par with other states of the country," he added. </p><p>Kant said the forest-rich Himalayan state has received Rs 9,000 crore from the Fourteenth Finance Commission. </p><p>"While it is 50:50 for fund allocation to rest of the country, Arunachal is lucky to get fund at 90:10 ratio, the old rate of special category state, what more do you expect? Dont think of fund, utilise them judiciously for the fund flow to continue," Kant said. </p><p>"There is no dearth of funds, but the fund should be utilised jusiciously. There was no governance in the state as there were huge revenue leakages. Now there is a responsive and transparent government and the Centre will extend all possible help to take the state to the zenith of development," Kant added.
