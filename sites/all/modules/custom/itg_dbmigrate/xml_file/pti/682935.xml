<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) The BCCI today finally invited applications for the head coach of the Indian cricket team with the circular comprising a nine-point criteria including one stating a desire to have a Hindi speaking coach.      BCCI president Anurag Thakur had announced on May 22 that the Board will advertise to fill the vacant position but it finally put out the invitation today. The application deadline remains June 10, as announced by Thakur on May 22.      "Communication skills befitting the coach of an International team are mandatory along with the ability to effectively convey the right messages and must demonstrate proficiency in English. It is desirable to communicate in Hindi and other regional Indian languages," reads point number six of the criteria.      The BCCI wants that the incumbent "should have also successfully coached a cricket team of any of the member countries of the ICC, at the first class or at the International level."      "It is preferred that the candidate should be qualified through a certification/assessment program conducted by any of the full member countries and currently possess such a valid certification," reads point three of the circular.      It has been learnt that Ravi Shastri, who was team director until the World T20, will apply for the job and so will his support staff comprising Sanjay Bangar and Bharat Arun.      Besides that, the candidate should be able to prepare and present a coaching plan for India to attain leadership in all formats of the game.      "Demonstrate methods/tools to effectively measure individual player performance and present metrics to the Board, which will in turn measure the performance of the team, on a consistent and timely basis," it read further.      "Demonstrate an understanding and ability of employing a multi disciplinary approach that will include sports psychology and sports medicine, and effectively manage the work load of the players, thereby enhancing their contribution to the cause of the team."      The BCCI also wants somebody who does not have a track record of being embroiled in controversies.      "Mandatory that the candidate should have an impeccable personal record, devoid of any past or current disputes, with any of the member boards of the ICC or its affiliates."
