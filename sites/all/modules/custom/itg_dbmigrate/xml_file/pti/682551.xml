<storybody><![CDATA[<p>interacting with Rahul as Vice-President. Executive decisions are being taken by him. I find him very perceptive, he asks pertinent questions and he agrees what you say, if he feels it is right."     "Sonia is a brilliant leader, but you know we have to give (pause). Why am I wanting to quit (fighting 2017 as last elections), because I think enough is enough.     I think the new generation has emerged and the baton should be passed to the new generation," he said.     "Similarly, I think Soniaji wants to do the same. Nobody is asking her to handover (the baton). It is her own thinking that she would like Rahul to take over. And that of course when the matter is put before the party, I am sure we will all endorse Rahul," he said. (Reopen DEL24)      Asked if he has full faith in Rahuls leadership, the former Punjab CM further said, "I have been interacting with him on many occasions. Everybody learns and I think in the last 4-5 years, he has learnt a lot. I am meeting him even tomorrow."      When asked if he will make a good leader, he replied, "I am sure he will make a good leader."      He also added that Rahul belongs to a family in which politics runs in its blood right from  Moti Lal Nehru to Jawahar Lal Nehru to Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.     When asked what about Priyanka Gandhi, he said, "I hope she will come into (active politics).  I have always suggested that she must come into this thing. She will be a great asset to the Congress President and the Vice-President."     Asked if Rahul will get full support of the party, he said, "why not. There is a system of take over, it is not Amarinder Singh announcing or Sonia ji announcing, the party will meet on the issue." PTI SUN VSC</p>]]></storybody>
