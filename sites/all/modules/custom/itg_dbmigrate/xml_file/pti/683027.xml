<storybody><![CDATA[<p>On inspection of the NGOs accounts, the Home Ministry said, it was noticed Rs 13.03 lakh out of foreign contribution "have been spent on travel, boarding, lodging etc., used for advocacy including advocacy with MPs or media, to organise rallies or dharnas, draft legislation meetings" even though as per the foreign contribution return filed, there was no such mention. </p><p>However, in its reply, the NGO has argued that the dharna etc., took place in 2009 when the FCRA, 2010 was not in force. </p><p>"It may be mentioned here that the Association organised such rallies or dharnas not only in 2009 but also in 2011 and 2014. Moreover, organising such rallies or dharnas with political hue and colour by utilising foreign contribution was also not allowed under FCRA 1976, which was in force in 2009. </p><p>"The utilisation of foreign contribution for advocacy indulging in lobbying with MPs and thereby influencing the political process and Parliamentary institutions in in clear violation of letter nd spirit of the Act as enshrined in the introduction to FCRA 2010," the Home Ministry said. </p><p>The Home Ministry in its notice said Anand Grover, who is a trustee of the NGO, had appeared in Novartis case in the Supreme Court by spending foreign contribution which was clearly not meant for that purpose. </p><p>Grover, the Home Ministry said, was appointed as United Nations Special Rapporteur (UNSR) on Right to Health vide Human Rights Council on June 27, 2008. During the period 2008- 2014, one of the foreign donors donated USD 95,000, USD 97,000, USD 93,896 and USD 89,599 to the NGO, specifically to assist him in his work as UN Special Rapporteur. </p><p>In the minutes of the trustees meeting (November 3, 2007 and February 23, 2008), regarding appointment as UN Special Rapporteur for health, Grover stated that he was not getting any salary for this job and only received travelling expenses per day. </p><p>Consequently, he availed a foreign contribution for various purposes, including visit to foreign countries. This was not an activity listed in the objectives of the Association and therefore the Association violated certain FCRA provisions "by working as a conduit to receive foreign contribution on behalf of Anand Grover and transferring same to him," the notice said. </p><p>A total of Rs 22.53 lakh was spent from foreign contribution received by NGO against various national and international air travels of Grover and on telephone calls and internet charges, for purchasing foreign currency to pay him and other foreigners in violation of provisions of FCRA 2010, relating to transfer and utilisation of foreign contribution. </p><p>Further foreign contribution was spent for air travel and other expenses of contractual employees or workers of other organisations, foreigners to attend conferences in Kathmandu, Malaysia, Kenya, Vienna and Bangkok besides others places in violation of FCRA norms, the Home Ministry notice said. </p><p>As per the notice, the NGO has a designated bank account with Standard and Chartered Bank in Mumbai, but it had maintained accounts in HSBC Bank branches in Mumbai and Bangalore which were not reported to the government.
