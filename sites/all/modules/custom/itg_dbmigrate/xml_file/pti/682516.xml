<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) Counselling sessions for Delhi University undergraduate course aspirants- "Open Days" began here today with the varsity witnessing a housefull of students and parents seeking answers to admission related queries. </p><p>From calculation of best-four percentage to the best college for a particular course, there were endless queries for DU officials to answer during the session. </p><p>The sessions will continue till June 11 and will be held across a host of venues. </p><p>Every year before the admission process begins for its undergraduate courses, Delhi University conducts "Open Days", or sessions to which students and parents are invited to get their admission-related queries addressed by DU staff. </p><p>If mathematics will be compulsory for economics honours aspirants? Will a candidate be allowed to take economics even if she has not studied the subject at the Class XII level? Legal studies and Mass media studies are to be considered as academic subject or electives? Is there any relaxation in cut-off for girl students? These were few of the questions that were asked by the participants during the session. </p><p>DUs Deputy Dean of Students Welfare Gurpreet Tuteja also briefed the participants about the documents required to be submitted for admission and also explained the detailed procedure since the process has been made entirely online for the first time. </p><p>"We have arranged for servers keeping in mind the expected rush on the university website but if students face some difficulty we urge them to return to the site again after sometime," he added. </p><p>Admissions to over 60,000 seats in DUs various undergraduate courses began today and the online registration will conclude on June 19. </p><p>The first cut-off list will be announced on June 27 and the varsity will release only five cut-off lists. </p><p>The sessions will be held in two batches from 10 AM to 1 PM and 4-7 PM from June 1 to 4 at the Universitys conference centre. The venue for the same on June 6 will be SGTB Khalsa College followed by Sri Venketeshwara College next day. </p><p>On June 8-9, open days will be held at Zakir Hussain College and at South Campus on June 10-11.
