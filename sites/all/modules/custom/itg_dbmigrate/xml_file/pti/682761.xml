It is not the case that I have refused to participate in any event. I have given all the medical certificates for my injury. Financial assistance was given to him (Sushil) under the target Olympic podium scheme." </p><p>He further said that WFI should conduct selection trial for Olympics as it was required under the Sports Code. </p><p>"Not having a trial is direct violation of the Sports Code. No written policy of WFI is there for selecting athletes from international events like Olympics. There is no policy on the basis of which the WFI can say that earning a quota at the world championship gives you a berth for Olympics," he said. </p><p>When Sibal stressed that there was no written policy, the court asked, "You (Sushil) have been selected by WFI so many times. Was it through the same process that you were selected earlier?" </p><p>To this, Sibal said Sushil was selected in a fair manner by WFI and the best athelete has to be send for international events. </p><p>He referred to the procedure followed by other countries, including USA, Russia and Canada, and said that there was no country in the world which relies on performance in the world wrestling championship. </p><p>He said even other sports associations in India conducts selection trial for the Olympics. </p><p>"Internal selection trial closer to the main event is important to access the current form of the athlete. You do not want champion but the best wrestlers," he said, adding, "You want to have a person in the Olympics who is in form." </p><p>"How can WFI say that they do not know what is happening abroad. They do not even see what the other associations in the country are doing," he said and added that other countries had conducted trial for Olympics in the month of April-May. </p><p>During the earlier hearing, the high court had observed that Sushil and Yadav should not be used as "pawns" in the "politics" of the wrestling federation. </p><p>WFI had earlier told the court that Yadav was a better bet than Sushil in the 74 kg freestyle category at the Rio 2016. </p><p>Yadavs counsel had told the court that the athlete who secures a quota, represents the country in the Olympics. </p><p>Sushil had approached the high court after his name did not figure in Indias Rio preparatory camp.
