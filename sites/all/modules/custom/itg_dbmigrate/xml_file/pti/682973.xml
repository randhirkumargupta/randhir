<storybody><![CDATA[<p>While Sebi acceded to the BSEs request to withhold the     While Sebi acceded to the BSEs request to withhold the pay-out of securities and funds for the trades executed on July 27, 2015, the stock exchange conducted a surprise inspection at the registered office of the company in Ahmedabad, where premises were found to be closed. </p><p>"The registered office was empty premises without any furniture or office equipment no operation was found to be carried out from said registered office. From visit to the aforementioned sites it was revealed that company exists at the corporate office, however, they could not provide any documents to show that any operation activities are carried out from said office," Sebi order said. </p><p>BSE subsequently suspended trading in its shares. </p><p>After further investigations into the KYC documents and bank statements of various entities having sold the shares, it was found that a large number of them were connected to each other. </p><p>Sebi also called for Call Data Records (CDR) from telecom operators about the entities that had sent SMSes to lure investors. These senders included BSEBull, StAxis and HBJCAP. </p><p>Besides approaching the cyber crime cell, BSE also issued notice to the owner of the domain name at their email address and to Godaddy, the registrar of the website. </p><p>In a 38 page order, Sebi said "BSE shall withhold the pay-out of funds for the trades executed on July 27, 2015 and keep the same in interest bearing escrow account". </p><p>Further, "BSE shall release the securities to the buyers for the trades executed on July 27, 2015," it added. </p><p>Dhyana group entities were also found to be the net buyers to the preferential allottees and thereby created artificial demand for the supply of shares from preferential allottees. </p><p>Sebi noted that after release of lock-in, entities of Dhyana group had bought substantial shares of the Dhyana from the preferential allottees. </p><p>Also, the group provided a hugely profitable exit to the allottees, as 39 preferential allottees made a collective profit Rs 107.43 crores on a collective investment of 5.22 Crore, a whopping return of approximately 2,060 per cent on their investment in a period of 20 months. </p><p>"The preferential allotment was used as a tool for implementation of the dubious plan, device and artifice of Dhyana group and allottees" Sebi said. </p><p>"I prima facie find that Dhyana group and allottees used securities market system to artificially increase volume and price of the scrip for making illegal gains to and to convert ill-gotten gains into genuine one," the regulator added.
