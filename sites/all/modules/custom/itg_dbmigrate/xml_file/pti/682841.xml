<storybody><![CDATA[<p>London/New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) Tata Steel today announced completion of sale of its European long steel business, including the giant Scunthorpe plant, to Greybull Capital LLP. </p><p>Besides Scunthorpe steelworks in England, Tata Steel has sold mills in Teesside and northern France, which employ a total of 4,800 people, the company said in a statement.      The transaction was announced back in April for a nominal one pound, marking the revival of the brand name British Steel.      Workers have accepted a temporary 3 per cent pay cut and changes to terms and conditions in April as part of the deal to salvage the business.      Community unions general secretary, Roy Rickhuss, said: "Community warmly welcomes the opening of this new chapter in the course of the UK steel industry. It also demonstrates that there is the chance of a brighter future for steelmaking in the UK, with the right vision and investment."      Tata Steel has yet to find a buyer for the remainder of the UK business, but according to the Financial Times, will announce the preferred bidder on June 24, a day after the European Union (EU) referendum in the UK.      "Tata Steel UK today announced the completion of the sale of its Long Products Europe business to Greybull Capital LLP," the statement said. </p><p>The company, which had in March announced plans to sell all its UK operations after years of losses, had been in exclusive talks for the long products business with London-based private equity firm Greybull since December. </p><p>Greybull had previously said it will invest 400 million pounds (USD 569 million) in the new business.      "From today the Long Products Europe business, which in the UK includes the Scunthorpe steelworks, two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York, and associated distribution facilities, as well as a rail mill in northern France, will trade under the name of British Steel. All together the business employs 4,800 people ? 4,400 in the UK and 400 in France," it said. </p><p>Tata Steel said, in last one year, the Long Products Europe business has implemented a transformation plan including a portfolio restructuring of assets, underpinned by committed support from employees and their trade unions.      "This has focused the business on higher-value markets supported by a more competitive cost base," it said.      Bimlendra Jha, Executive Chairman of the Long Products Europe business and CEO of Tata Steel UK, said: "As a responsible seller, Tata Steel is delighted to have secured a buyer for this business and we hope that under Greybull ownership, the business will continue the momentum of the improvement programme that has been initiated in the last 12 months."      He said employees and trade unions have worked closely with the Long Products Europe management team to improve the business prospects, putting it in a more competitive position than it has been for many years.      "It is through their dedication and hard work that we are in this position today in spite of continued challenges in the market," he added. PTI AK/RNK ANZ MR</p>]]></storybody>
