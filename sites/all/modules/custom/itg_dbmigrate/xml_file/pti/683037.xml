<storybody><![CDATA[<p>(REOPENS DES73)</p><p>(REOPENS DES73) </p><p>Former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Pratap Singh Bajwa also said that it was right time for Rahul Gandhi to take over as the party chief. </p><p>"Indias 70 per cent population is under age of 40 years. Youngsters want younger faces. They want change to come in, new ideas to come in...if you see world over, you talk about American President, you talk about the Canadian Prime Minister, you talk about various other world leaders, they are all in their mid 40s and 50s," Bajwa said here today. </p><p>He said the younger leadership of the Congress was already looking for change. </p><p>"We the younger leadership of the Congress was already looking for a change," he said. </p><p>"I think that better sense seems to have prevailed with the senior leadership also. They have also started to say that Rahul Gandhi should be brought in," Bajwa said. </p><p>Batting for Rahul to take over the reins, Bajwa said, "If Rahul Gandhi is brought in with a new team, he is given a free hand and if he is given his own team, I am sure, over the coming years, Congress has a bright future ahead and he will turn around (Congress fortunes)." </p><p>Praising Rahul, Bajwa said, "He is a very honest, upright man and we know his pedigree, we know the work that his family and the Congress have done for this nation. This nation has already seen through the game of Mr (Narendra) Modi. He is already failing and he is going to fail in future very soon. So, we need a new face and he (Rahul) would be the right person and this is the right time to come." </p><p>"Senior leaders have also realised that till the time Rahul Gandhi is not elevated, he is not given his own team, he is not given a free hand, things will not change for the Congress. </p><p>"When Rahul gets independent hand, independent team, I am very much sure that the results will come for the Congress and the results will come for the nation also. It is very important that India stands united, India gets better leadership," Bajwa added. PTI SUN SMN</p>]]></storybody>
