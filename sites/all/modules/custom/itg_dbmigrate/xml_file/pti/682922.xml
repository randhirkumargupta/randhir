<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Chandigarh, June 1 (PTI) In an unusual outburst, Deputy Commissioner of Jhajjar in Haryana Anita Yadav, who has been severely criticised by the Prakash Singh Committee that probed Jat violence in February, today slammed its report, terming it as a "bundle of lies". </p><p>She insisted that she was not given the opportunity to be heard as she noted that "principles of natural justice" say that one has a right to be heard to tell ones side of the story.      The Prakash Singh Committee has made strong comments against Yadav, saying she was the most non-performing DC as she not only failed to provide leadership but her role was also very negative. The Committee, in its report, said it found her "unfit" to hold charge of a district. </p><p>"This report is a bundle of lies. There is not even an iota of truth in this. This report is to save the police by the police (Prakash Singh is a retd IPS officer). We were not even given the opportunity of being heard," Yadav told reporters when asked to comment about adverse observations made against her in the report. </p><p>"A DM (DC) heads a district, but she is not heard. Whatever statements were given by the IG, the report was made final on that basis. My SDM was also not heard," she said, while insisting that "We tried our best in the given circumstances."      Jhajjar, along with Rohtak, was the epicentre of the violence during the Jat quota stir in February.      Contradicting reports that machine guns were placed at the house of judicial officers in Jhajjar district during Jat stir violence, she said, "this is absolutely false. A machine gun was placed at one place where IG himself was camping. The Committee report says that machine guns were there on the rooftops of judges houses. That is absolutely false."      She hit out at Prakash Singh, who had recently claimed that certain people had tried to make him issue a "clean chit" to some wrongdoers.     "Prakash Singh has said that he was approached by some people. Who were these people and they approached him for whom. If that was the case, why did Prakash Singh not withdraw himself from this inquiry. He should have lodged a complaint, why did he not do so," the DC said.      The Prakash Singh Committee has made strong comments against Yadav, saying she was the most non-performing DC as she not only failed to provide leadership, but her role was also very negative. </p><p>Senior officers had difficulty contacting her and there were instances when she did not appoint magistrates promptly, the panel said in its report.      The panel, in its 451-page report on violence during the Jat quota stir, which claimed 30 lives, has said the "administrative paralysis" had gripped the state and the "highest functionaries in the government failed to show the kind of guidance, direction and control that is expected in a crisis of such proportions".
