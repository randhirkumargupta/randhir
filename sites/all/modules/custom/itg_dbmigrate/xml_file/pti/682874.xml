<storybody><![CDATA[<p>From M Zulqernain </p><p>Lahore, Jun 1 (PTI) A Pakistani man, who accused JuD of running a Taliban-style parallel judicial system here, today said he was "kidnapped" by two unidentified men who warned him of severe consequences if he continued pursuing the case against Hafiz Saeeds Sharia court. </p><p>"I have filed an application with the Lyton Road police station for registration of FIR against two unidentified men with long beard for kidnapping, intoxicating and threatening me," Khalid Saeed said. </p><p>"Yesterday I was going to the Lahore High Court on a motorcycle when two unidentified men having long beard stopped me near the court and took me to Miani Sahib graveyard and warned me of severe consequences if I continued pursuing the case," he said, adding the men forced him to drink some juice before throwing him at the entrance of the graveyard in a semi-conscious state.      Khalid was taken to a hospital where he received medical aid and was later discharged. </p><p>"I have filed the application with the police but they have yet to register an FIR against the unidentified men," he said. </p><p>Khalid is pursuing a case against Jamat-ud-Dawah (JuD), led by Mumbai attack mastermind Saeed, in the Lahore High Court (LHC) for receiving summons written on a letter pad of Darul Qaza Al-Sharia of JuD with a direction to appear before its arbitration court of Sharia. </p><p>He also received telephone calls from the Qazi (judge) of the JuD court in threatening tone asking him to appear before him. </p><p>The JuDs Sharia Court had summoned Saeed on the complaint of his former partner in a property business. </p><p>The LHC disposed off the petition and ordered the home secretary of the Punjab government to summon all concerned and decide the matter "strictly in accordance with law". However, the petitioner filed an intra-court appeal against the decision. The LHC chief justice has constituted a division bench headed by Justice Shahid Waheed to hear the appeal. </p><p>The federal and provincial governments had told the court that the petition was not maintainable as the JuD is a "private organisation" and this matter could not be challenged in the court.
