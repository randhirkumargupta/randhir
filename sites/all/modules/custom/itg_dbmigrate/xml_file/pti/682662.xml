<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Bengaluru, June 1 (PTI) An independent candidates nomination papers for the June 11 biennial elections to fill four Rajya Sabha seats from Karnataka were rejected after scrutiny today.  � � K A Mohans papers were rejected for not enclosing proposers names and an additional affidavit, Assembly Secretary S Murthy, also the Returning Officer, told PTI.   � �Three Congress candidates including former Union ministers Jairam Ramesh, Oscar Fernandes and former IPS� officer K C Ramamurthy and B M Farooq of JDS had on May 30 filed their nominations.      Union Minister Nirmala Seetharaman has been fielded by the BJP.     �Congress decision to field third candidate, Ramamurthy, has given tense moments to JDS, which needs five additional votes to see its candidate through, as it has 40 members. </p><p>Five JDS legislators, including Zameer Ahmed, have reportedly decided to back the third candidate of Congress.   � �Meanwhile, nomination papers of independent candidates, Mohan and Viratayya Hiremath, for the June 10 Legislative Council elections were rejected for not enclosing proposers names or additional affidavit.      The candidates in the fray include former minister V Somanna as BJPs first candidate and Lehar Singh Siroya, who has been fielded as partys second candidate despite not having the numbers in the Lower House.      The Council election has turned interesting with the entry of Singh into the fray, after the JDS which can only get one candidate elected, also fielded a second candidate too.  � � To see their second candidate through, the JDS, under the leadership of H D Kumaraswamy, is seeking support of the BJP.     �However, BJP has fielded its second candidate, which is being considered to be a political move to strengthen their position when JDS approaches them for negotiations.      A candidate needs 29 votes for victory in the elections. � � �While the elections are being held for the seven seats, the ruling Congress has fielded four candidates as its numerical strength in the Assembly is adequate to ensure their victory.
