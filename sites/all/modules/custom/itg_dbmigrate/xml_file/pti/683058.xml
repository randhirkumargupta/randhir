<storybody><![CDATA[<p>RSS leader </p><p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) The prevailing agrarian crisis has its origin in the policies adopted in the post-independence period, a senior RSS leader said today as he insisted on critical assessment of the practices followed during the Green Revolution to ascertain if those actually benefited people. </p><p>"We need to ponder over if agricultural practices adopted in the name of Green Revolution actually benefited us. This needs to be reviewed honestly, needs to be studied, based on which our policies for the future can be drafted," RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi said. </p><p>He said the agricultural policies adopted after 1947 were "different from the countrys psyche" leading to current problems. </p><p>"I wont raise question on the honesty of the leadership then but their thinking though is questionable. The policies drafted in a bid to take the country forward were different from the original psyche of the country, following which we are faced with current problems," he said. </p><p>These policies ended the freedom farmers enjoyed and made them dependent on "big companies" for seeds, fertilisers and other input aspects, he said. </p><p>"All the cultural aspects relating to agriculture have vanished, only physical indicators like how much production is taking place have become important. If this is the parameter, then I believe we have somewhere compromised with our psyche," he said. </p><p>The RSS leader made a strong pitch for adopting agricultural policies "which are in sync with the countrys culture". </p><p>"It is a big challenge to bring about a change in the practices. We need to develop a psyche to accept the challenge," he said and insisted that the diversity in the countrys agriculture sector needs to be maintained. </p><p>Joshi made these remarks at an event to release Agricultural Atlas of Madhya Pradesh, which chronicles the farm sector in the BJP-ruled state. </p><p>The event, organised by Madhya Pradesh Council for Science and Technology and Centre for Policy Studies here, was also attended by senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi. </p><p>The BJP veteran insisted on collection of accurate data for framing "right agricultural policies" and suggested studying the social changes agricultural practices have caused. </p><p>"The countrys agricultural production has gone up but people are leaving villages. Such scenario needs to be studied before drafting socio-economic policies for future," he said. </p><p>Former BJP leader KN Govindacharya and Bharatiya Kisan Sanghs organising secretary DK Kulkarni were also present at the event.
