<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles, Jun 1 (PTI) Singer Alicia Keys, who is gearing up to release her sixth studio album later this summer, says the songs were partly inspired by the pressures women face to be perfect. </p><p>"Before I started my new album, I wrote a list of all the things that I was sick of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women," Keys wrote in an essay for Lenny Letter. </p><p>Keys, 35, writes about one new song, "When A Girl Cant Be Herself," that addresses these issues with blunt admission. </p><p>"I realized that during this process, I wrote a lot of songs about masks filled with metaphors about hiding," she said. </p><p>She says she put the song aside and didnt think much about it until she had a photoshoot for the new album. </p><p>"Id just come from the gym, had a scarf under my baseball cap, and the beautiful photographer Paola (never met a Paola I didnt like) said, I have to shoot you right now, like this! The music is raw and real, and these photos have to be too! </p><p>The photo that came from this session became the artwork for Keys first single from the album, "In Common." </p><p>The singer describes the image as "intimately relating, me and that baseball hat and scarf and a bunch of invisible magic circulating. And I swear it is the strongest, most empowered, most free, and most honestly beautiful that I have ever felt." PTI BK ASV</p>]]></storybody>
