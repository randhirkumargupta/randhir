<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Mumbai, Jun 1 (PTI) Actor Akshaye Khanna says he is excited to be back on the big screen after a long sabbatical, in which he was dealing with some personal issues. </p><p>The actor, who last appeared in 2012 comedy "Gali Gali Chor Hai", will be now seen in action-adventure "Dishoom", which co-stars John Abraham and Varun Dhawan. </p><p>"I had some personal issues which I had to sort out so, I couldnt work for a while. I am thrilled to be back with this film (Dishoom) and a couple of more films this year," Khanna told reporters here. </p><p>In the Rohit Dhawan-directed movie, the 41-year-old actor plays a character named Wagha, who kidnaps Indias best cricket player right before an India versus Pakistan final match. </p><p>The "Dil Chahta Hai" star says it was just a one line narration of the film that got him excited. </p><p>"For me, it was just one line of the film which was so fresh. 36 hours before India Pakistan final match, a major Indian cricketer gets kidnapped. Just that one liner is so interesting and fresh," he said at the trailer launch of "Dishoom". </p><p>"And the fact that I kidnap him makes it even more nicer. Thats the reason I was interested in the film," he added. </p><p>Akshaye, who has acted in films like "Border", "Taal", "Race", says he is "always" scared of the media. </p><p>When asked if he is nervous facing the media after a long time, Akshaye quipped, "I have always been scared of the media so nothing new." </p><p>The film, scheduled to release on July 29, also features Jacqueline Fernandez in the lead role.
