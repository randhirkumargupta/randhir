<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Patna, May 31 (PTI) The Bihar ruling JD(U) today questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP for nominating "mining mafia" Gopal Narayan Singh as the partys candidate for Rajya Sabha polls from Bihar. </p><p>"...both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP have completely been exposed with the nomination of mining mafia Gopal Narayan Singh for Rajya Sabha poll from Bihar," JD(U) chief spokesman Sanjay Singh told reporters. </p><p>"Gopal Narayan Singh has 28 cases against him including those of attempt to murder, robbery, forgery, under arms act, mining act etc. PM and the BJP president Amit Shah should explain as to why a mining mafia has been given a ticket," he said. </p><p>Gopal Narayan Singh, who was formerly BJPs state unit president, today filed nomination papers for Rajya Sabha, along with two other party who filed for Legislative Council. </p><p>Singh, who was accompanied by party leader and national spokesman Ajay Alok, said Gopal Narayan Singh has been booked under mining act and various sections of IPC including section 307 (attempt to murder), section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), section 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others). </p><p>Alleging that PMs "actions do not match his words", Alok said the Modi government in its first Cabinet decision had asked the Law Ministry to prepare a roadmap to complete the trials of charge-sheeted MPs within a year and if it was not possible, then there should be a provision to debar the such legislators from voting inside the House. </p><p>Earlier, when question regarding cases pending against BJP RS nominee was asked to senior party leader Sushil Kumar Modi he had brushed it aside saying "one dozen cases due to political rivalry have been foisted on me too." </p><p>In his Mann Ki Baat programme aired on May 22, 2016, the PM talked of protecting the environment but "to my utter surprise, Singh was given ticket who is facing 16 (out of 28) cases of environmental violations," Alok said. </p><p>Both the spokesmen, especially Sanjay Singh, who is generally critical of Sushil Modi, today heaped praise on him saying that he (Sushil), politics apart, would have been far better candidate than Gopal Narayan Singh in Bihars interest.
