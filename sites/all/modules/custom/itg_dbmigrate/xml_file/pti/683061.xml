LC till today has not received the order purportedly issued on 31st May, 2016, though it is available to the press," it said. </p><p>The MHA notice claimed that on inspection of the NGOs accounts, it was noticed that Rs 13.03 lakh out of foreign contribution "have been spent on travel, boarding lodging etc., used for advocacy including advocacy with MPs or media, to organise rallies or dharnas, draft legislation meetings" even though as per the foreign contribution return filed, there was no such mention. </p><p>However, in its reply, the NGO has argued that the dharna etc., took place in 2009 when the FCRA, 2010 was not in force. </p><p>"It may be mentioned here that the Association organised such rallies or dharnas not only in 2009 but also in 2011 and 2014. Moreover, organising such rallies or dharnas with political hue and colour by utilising foreign contribution was also not allowed under FCRA 1976, which was in force in 2009,"" the ministry said.
