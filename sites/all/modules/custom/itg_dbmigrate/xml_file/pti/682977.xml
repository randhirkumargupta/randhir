<storybody><![CDATA[<p>New Delhi, Jun 1 (PTI) Titan Company Ltd, which sells jewellery under the Tanishq brand, has retained its 15 per cent revenue growth forecast in the segment despite a dip in the previous fiscal. </p><p>"The company maintains its previous guidance in terms of targeted growth for the current fiscal year of 15 per cent revenue growth and network additions of 20-25 stores adding up to approximately 100,000 sq feet of retail space," said Titan in an investor conference in Singapore and Hong Kong. </p><p>Besides, Titan would add up to 25 new jewellery stores this fiscal and launch "aesthetically superior and relevant collections" to boost customer walk-ins and new customers who are willing to spend on new products and collections. </p><p>The Tata group controlled firm had reported a decline of 5.33 per cent in its consolidated total income to Rs 11,277.94 crore for the 2015-16 fiscal. </p><p>Its net sales from jewellery segment was also down 7.55 per cent to Rs 8,717.40 crore as against Rs 9,429.97 crore during 2014-15. </p><p>Titan further said that its Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) is getting good enrollments and it has been able to influence the customers to redeem faster, thereby churning the customers faster and releasing limits for new enrollments. </p><p>Under GHS, a customer needs to pay a fixed amount every month with Tanishq for fixed period and at the end of the scheme he can purchase jewellery from Tanishq with the matured amount. </p><p>"We believe that with the revision of the net worth (after the end of financial year 2015-16) and momentum of customer redemptions, there is a healthy scope to scale the companys GHS scheme further," it said. </p><p>Titan also informed that there was no material impact on the sales of Tanishq this fiscal due to governments new rule which had made permanent account number (PAN) mandatory for all transactions above Rs 2 lakh. </p><p>"The secular impact of PAN card threshold revision to Rs 200,000 is yet to become visible but the cash sales of the company between Rs 200,000 and Rs 500,000 is less than 10 per cent of the revenue of the division and we believe less than half of it may get impacted... Hence the overall impact should not be very material," said Titan. </p><p>In the watch segment, Titan said that it was under pressure due to various market phenomena and the company has decided to take a two year period to redefine and rejuvenate this business. </p><p>"The division has been affected as the relevance of the watches category amongst the young generation has been diminishing to some extent. Also, significant share of wallet has shifted, out of the category, due to heavy discounting on other categories and customers are moving towards snacking on e-commerce platforms," it said. </p><p>Its eye wear division has plans for "aggressive brick and mortar as well as omni channel expansion" in the coming financial year and would target a double digit growth. </p><p>"The gross margins in the business are very good and it will take two years for the business to ramp up to steady state EBIT margins," said Titan.
