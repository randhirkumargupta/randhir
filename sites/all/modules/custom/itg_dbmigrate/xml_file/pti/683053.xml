<storybody><![CDATA[<p>extends it to gaushalas </p><p>Chandigarh, June 1 (PTI) Haryana government today decided to withdraw exemption to its buildings and establishments from paying municipal taxes even as it extended the benefit to gaushalas (cowshed), and religious instititions. </p><p>These and several other key decisions were taken at a meeting on property tax under Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar here, an official release said. </p><p>In another significant decision, it was decided to give freedom to municipal corporation and councils to fix rates of property tax depending on the area and value of property. </p><p>Till now, the state government used to do it. The state government would henceforth fix only the floor and the ceiling rates of properties. </p><p>The Chief Minister directed officers of Urban Local Bodies Department to exempt gaushalas from the payment of taxes, the release said. </p><p>Similarly, religious institutions like temple, gurudwara, and mosque should also be exempt from payment of tax provided they are not being used for any commercial purposes, it added. </p><p>He also directed the officers to levy minimum property tax on working women hostels in the state. </p><p>In the meeting, Khattar also directed the officers to prepare a scheme for auto-debit of payment of property and other taxes through banks. </p><p>He said the scheme would facilitate the government to automatically debit the payment from the account of beneficiaries on account of various services being provided by different government departments. </p><p>This, he said, would help in save time and money on generation of bill and its payment. He said initially, the scheme should be started in government to government mode. </p><p>Later on, the scope of the scheme should be expanded. PTI SUN TIR ZMN TIR</p>]]></storybody>
