<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Patna, Jun 1 (PTI) Stung by the media expose of "dubious" toppers of class 12th examination conducted by Bihar board,state Education Minister Ashok Choudhary today said a high level probe has been ordered to re-check merit of the toppers. </p><p>The probe would be conducted in all the three streams - Humanities, Science and Commerce--and merit of examiners who awarded the marks would also be checked, he told PTI. </p><p>Video of a girl who topped the state governments +2 examination in Humanities pronouncing Political Science as Prodigal Science and describing it as a subject related to cooking, while that of a boy who topped in Science but was unaware of electron and proton, exposed the results of the exam conducted by Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) this year. </p><p>Both toppers hail from Bishun Rai college in Bhagwanpur in Vaishali district. The institution had courted controversy last year as well when the then Education Minister P K Shahi had ordered withholding its results following complaints of large-scale irregularities. </p><p>"Five merit holders of all the three streams of Science,Arts and Commerce will be re-examined by an expert team to know the truth of the excellent marks awarded to them by examiners," Choudhary said. </p><p>The state Education minister sounded perturbed over "lapse" shown by the board in publication of results. The incident has once again shown the state in a poor light after a photograph of parents and well wishers scaling a school building in Vaishali district last year during matriculation exam to supply chits to examinees went viral. </p><p>"I admit lapse on the part of the state examination board despite all efforts of the government to conduct a cheating-free examination," the minister said. </p><p>"After a lot of hard work the state government had conducted cheating-free examination this time to erase its bad image due to copying in matriculation exam last year ... But the expose of toppers has once again tarnished the governments image. </p><p>"We will dismiss officials found guilty in committing this irregularity," the minister said.
