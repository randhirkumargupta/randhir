<storybody><![CDATA[<p>And investment too ? in both directions ? is well below</p><p>And investment too ? in both directions ? is well below what it could, and perhaps should, be, she added. </p><p>She also said that as India has a much larger population, there is a view in some quarters that this means the country can satisfy its growth requirements through its large domestic market. </p><p>"But I think India would be selling itself well short were it to take this stance.  We can look at China, a country of similar dimensions to India, to see an example of the enormous contribution that international trade can make to national economic growth," she said. </p><p>The Indian economy has become more market-oriented, including easier access for foreign investment and reductions in tariffs "albeit to still high average levels," she added. </p><p>Sidhu further said trade is not about winning more than the other party, it is about win-win. </p><p>Talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), she said it allows for new members to join in the future, which will amplify its benefits. </p><p>About RCEP, she said it holds significant economic potential. </p><p>"Through commitments on goods, services and investment RCEP will provide the economic architecture to support ongoing trade and investment liberalisation in the region. And its potential significance for India should not be underestimated. </p><p>It represents a substantial market for Indian goods, services, but also for Indian technology, intellectual property and human capital," she said. </p><p>It would also help provide India access to the regions vast pools of capital, vital to building the infrastructure necessary to support a modern, thriving economy, she said. </p><p>"From my perspective, India should have a regional voice commensurate with its size and economic weight.  Australia supports India?s growing participation in the economic architecture of the region," the High Commissioner said. </p><p>"Our increasing reference to the Indo-Pacific, rather than the earlier term of Asia-Pacific, reflects this desire to embrace India as a key contributor to building regional cooperation and integration," she said.  </p><p>RCEP provides an ideal forum in which India can contribute in shaping and influencing the rules governing trade and investment in the region and Australia is keen to work with India to achieve a sufficiently ambitious RCEP outcome, she added.
