The Foundation has enjoyed and derived the benefits of the order while disowning the liabilities arising therefrom. It preferred to enter into multiplicity of litigation rather than comply with its undertaking which is unequivocal and unconditional. It amounts to circumventing of law. </p><p>"Though the uncalled statements allegedly made to the print and electronic media by the Foundation were completely disowned during the course of hearing but the subsequent actions of the Foundation are rather in conformity with such statements, than in line with intent to comply with the voluntary, unequivocal and unconditional undertaking given to the Tribunal by the Foundations and its office bearers," the bench said. </p><p>It said that the AOL foundation and its Trustees have failed to abide by the solemn and voluntary undertaking given to the Tribunal and "enjoyed the benefits of holding an event without discharging its liabilities". </p><p>It further rapped the foundation for not cleaning the debris and other waste on the Yamuna floodplains after the completion of the three-day cultural festival. </p><p>"Though the Foundation had clearly taken a stand before the Tribunal that it would clean the entire debris and even remove the construction material from the food plain of river Yamuna, it did nothing of the sort. </p><p>"It was reported that when the Inspection Team on behalf of the Principal Committee went for inspection, they were not only obstructed; but also not permitted to conduct the inspection. </p><p>"Even in this manner the Foundation has obstructed compliance of the orders of the Tribunal. Besides all this, the Foundation is also guilty of withholding correct facts from the Tribunal," it said. PTI PKS RKS VMN</p>]]></storybody>
