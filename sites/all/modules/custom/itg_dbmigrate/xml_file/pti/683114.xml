<storybody><![CDATA[<p>From Sajjad Hussain </p><p>Islamabad, Jun 1 (PTI) A leading politician in Pakistan has written to Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swaraj for repatriation of a seven-year-old Pakistani boy who has been found in Rajasthan two years after he went missing. </p><p>Awami National Party (ANP) chief Asfandyar Wali Khan wrote a letter to Swaraj for repatriation of the boy named Tufail Ismail who is said to be in police custody in Rajasthan. </p><p>The ANP leader requested Swaraj to expedite the legal formalities for the repatriation of the child who went missing from Charsadda district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province two years ago, the Dawn reported. </p><p>"I have seen the Dawn report. I will ascertain the facts and take necessary action," Swaraj tweeted. </p><p>Khans letter said that an FIR of the missing child was registered in Parang Police Station, Charsadda. The parents have been searching for their child for the past two years. </p><p>With the help of social media, the child was found two months ago in Rajasthan and reports said he is in custody of Ganga Nagar district police station. His parents are desperately waiting to be reunited with their son, the letter said. </p><p>Tufail, who went missing two years ago while his family was shifting homes, was found two months ago when his maternal uncle in Saudi Arabia saw his picture with a phone number on social media shared by an Indian social worker Sujewa Pereira. </p><p>The boys uncle dialled the given number and was told he was in the custody of police in Rajasthan. </p><p>Last week, Tufails father said that it had been 45 days since he learnt of his childs whereabouts but had been unable to bring his son back to Pakistan. He had appealed to Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif to help bring his son home. PTI KUN</p>]]></storybody>
