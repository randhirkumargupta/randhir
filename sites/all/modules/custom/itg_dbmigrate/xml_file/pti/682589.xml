<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Congress asked that if there was even an iota of truth  </p><p>Congress asked that if there was even an iota of truth in the Governments charges, would they not have gone hammer & tongs against Congress leaders.      "They havent, because the allegations are all baseless. They are being made, and will be made by PM Modi in near future too, only with the intention of diverting peoples attention from his embarrassing economic failures.".      May 2014 gave a great opportunity to Modi to take India to greater heights, it said, insisting that he has "frittered away" the chance completely by choosing "hyper publicity over dedicated work and by attempting to silence all Opposition voices by cooking up false charges against them. "     </p><p>It claimed Modis strategy is simple - create negative hype around Congress party by "planting concocted" stories in media & create positive hype around Government work that "never took place."     </p><p>"The BJP has been leading this attack by employing their dirty tricks department to concoct half baked insinuations & selective leaks to media, to attack Congress President Sonia Gandhi," the commentary said.     </p><p>"Their latest was on the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, where no less than Union Ministers made public statements hinting at the complicity of Smt. Gandhi in falsely targeting the then CM of Gujarat, Narendra Modi," it said.      "They launched a slanderous campaign against senior Congress leadership, without realising that two courts found the encounter, which killed Ishrat Jahan to be Fake. </p><p>"A magisterial inquiry reported that Ishrat was innocent and was killed only because she was a Muslim and fitted the Gujarat polices idea of a terrorist," the party said.      Now, even the Home Ministry, in response to an RTI, has said that "there was no proof that Gandhi interfered with the Ministry of Home Affairs", the party said.      "BJP is a party thats ever busy crafting new allegations, which they keep alive for a few weeks, before moving on," it alleged. PTI SPG RT</p>]]></storybody>
