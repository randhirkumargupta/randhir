<storybody><![CDATA[<p>With Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti accusing National Conference founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah of changing his political stance after supporting Accession with India in 1947 and pushing Jammu and Kashmir into uncertainty, her party members have started openly speaking out against Sheikh and separatists.</p><p><b>THE STRIKE</b></p><p>"We have our reasons for talking about Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. He continues to be the epicentre of the modern history of Kashmir and plays a pivotal role in it. But, he created a lot of confusion. We are suffering because of his shifting stances," Nizamuddin Bhat, PDP General Secretary, told Mail Today.</p><p><b>SHEIKH BETRAYED HIS PEOPLE, SAYS PDP</b></p><p>He said Sheikh was a popular leader but he betrayed his people. On Saturday, in her speech in the Assembly, Mehbooba cited examples for rejecting Omar Abdullah Abdullah's assertions that her father was snubbed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when the latter in his address in Srinagar last year, told Mufti that he doesn't need advice on Pakistan after Mufti Mohammad Sayeed insisted that India and Pakistan should engage with each other.</p><p>She said her father had great respect for Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah but he would often question why Sheikh after supporting the Accession led people to different direction. On August 8, 1953, the then Sadr-i-Riyasat of the Sate, Karan Singh dismissed Sheikh Abdullah as Prime Minister on charges of having lost the confidence of his cabinet.</p><p>He was arrested on charges of anti-national activities and he was accused of being a Pakistani agent. He was denied an opportunity to prove his majority on the floor of the House. Sheikh, after his arrest, launched plebiscite movement.</p><p>Mehbooba said her father was a dignified man and his decisions would never be ego-based. She said unlike Sheikh, her father remained committed to the idea of India. Later, in the Upper House on Tuesday, she took on separatists, saying, "Taunt me of being anti-Muslim, but blessed Fridays in Srinagar have become occasions for throwing stones." "The chief minister has said nothing unusual. Sheikh Abdullah lied to people. He misled people. First, he supported the Accession, then he launched the plebiscite movement. PDP has remained Indian throughout history," Yasir Reshi, member of the Upper House said. He said, like Sheikh, both Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah were misleading people. "When they are out of power, they talk of autonomy," he said. Asked if it was the end of the soft separatism approach usually taken by PDP, he said, "PDP never had a soft-separatist approach."</p><p>Separatists have accused the Mehbooba-led government of putting them in continuous detention and said she is "implementing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh agenda" of changing demography of the state by giving nod to establishing separate colonies for Kashmiri pandits and the Sainik colony. Though the government has clarified that it would establish composite colonies for pandits and has no plans to establish Sainik colony, the separatists are not satisfied.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mehbooba-mufti-hits-out-at-jammu-and-kashmir-separatists/1/682172.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mehbooba-mufti-hits-out-at-jammu-and-kashmir-separatists/1/682172.html">Also read: Mehbooba Mufti hits out at Jammu and Kashmir separatists</a></b> </p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
