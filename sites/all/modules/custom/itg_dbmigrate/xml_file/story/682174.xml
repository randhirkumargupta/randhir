<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Emraan Hashmi normally prefers being reclusive about his emotions, but the the Bollywood actor was clearly overwhelmed with sentiment at the launch of his book, The Kiss Of Life: How A Superhero And My Son Defeated Cancer.</p><p><b>SURVIVING CANCER</b><br /></p><p>Hashmi's book talks of his experience as a father dealing with the situation where his son Ayaan was detected as having cancer, and how his little one fought against all odds to emerge a survivor. The book, co-authored by Bilal Siddiqi, talks of how Ayaan drew psychological inspiration from his favourite superheroes. Emraan recalls how he felt his life was almost taken away from him when his son, then just three, was diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>"My wife, my son and I had gone for a casual brunch at a plush hotel when we noticed certain abnormal symptoms in him. We rushed him to the hospital," he recalled.</p><p>Back home, Emraan recalls doing his own research on the symptoms. "What I saw on keying in the symptoms tore me apart. It said the dreaded 'C' word... Our worst fears manifested the next day as there was a tumour the size of a season ball on top of his kidney," the actor said.</p><p>Treatment in Canada followed, and Ayaan had to live following a strict diet chart. Emraan's co-author Bilal Siddiqi had shared the first look of the book earlier this year in March. Siddiqi has penned films such as Black Friday, Phantom and Shootout At Wadala.<br /><b><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/emraan-hashmi-wife-parveen-kisses-extremely-expensive-serial-kisser/1/681449.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/emraan-hashmi-wife-parveen-kisses-extremely-expensive-serial-kisser/1/681449.html">Also read: Emraan Hashmi's on-screen kisses are extremely expensive, thanks to his wife</a></b> </p>]]></storybody>
