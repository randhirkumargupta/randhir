<storybody><![CDATA[<p>West Indies batsman Chris Gayle responding to the sexism row surrounding him said that he has been the victim of "double standards". The left-handed batsman came under heavy criticism for asking Australian broadcaster Mel McLaughlin out on a date in a live television interview during a Big Bash League match in January.</p><p>"I wanted to see your eyes for the first time, hopefully we can win this game and then we can have a drink after as well," Gayle had said, before adding: "Don't blush, baby."</p><p>He was slammed by former players and Cricket Australia for making the comments. Melbourne Renegades, his BBL franchise imposed a heavy fine and <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/ipl2016/story/chris-gayle-loses-big-bash-league-contract-after-fresh-sexism-row/1/675981.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/ipl2016/story/chris-gayle-loses-big-bash-league-contract-after-fresh-sexism-row/1/675981.html">decided not to renew his contract.</a> </p><p>Gayle further fanned the sexism controversy by making yet another statement to a female reporter named Charlotte Edwardes from The Times Magazine.</p><p>The Jamaican boasted of his "very, very big bat", and asked Edwardes if she ever <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/ipl2016/story/chris-gayle-asks-female-journalist-have-you-ever-had-a-threesome/1/673910.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/ipl2016/story/chris-gayle-asks-female-journalist-have-you-ever-had-a-threesome/1/673910.html">"had a black man and been in a threesome".</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>After this comment, Indian Premier League bosses were forced to think about Gayle's future with the tournament. <br /></p><p><b>'HURT' GAYLE</b></p><p>However, Cricket Australia's rejection and humiliation has not gone down well with Gayle and said his contribution to launch the Big Bash has been ignored.</p><p>"I didn't feel like I was being treated right at that particular time," he said in an interview with the BBC World Service's Stumped programme.</p><p>"The way of going about it... and the media making a big mockery out of it. To go into details, it was straight up just a lot of double standards.</p><p>"That story didn't get me down one bit. It didn't affect me, I must say. It was just ridiculous how they go about it - trying to use me as a big scapegoat."</p><p>"For someone being part of the Big Bash for so many years, who actually built the Big Bash from day one, the same name they used to build the Big Bash is the same name they want to tarnish," he added.</p><p>"The Chris Gayle from the first season, if you check it, it was Chris Gayle who started that Big Bash and it blew up this big now - and next they want to say, 'you should ban Chris Gayle... you should get rid of Chris Gayle from all leagues around the world... Chris is sexist'.</p><p>"You can't brand me for running a joke like that, it's just unfortunate and people have their agenda against other people as well."</p><p>Gayle, a World Twenty20 winner this year with the West Indies team is a big hit in the T20 leagues all over the world.</p>]]></storybody>
