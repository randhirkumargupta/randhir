<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Interpol, the world's largest international police organisation with 190 member countries, has sent its first set of queries to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking case details against liquor baron Vijay Mallya.</p><p>Last month, the ED had sought a Red Corner Notice (RCN) against Mallya, who is wanted by 17 banks in India for defaulting around Rs 9400 crore. Soon after reviewing the RCN proposal, Interpol has sent its first set of queries to the ED, seeking reasons for RCN against Mallya. </p><p>IndiaToday.in spoke with few ED officials and got to know that the questionnaire is simple and specific.</p><p></p><p></p>        {funfacts}<div class="conclace-story-wrapper"><div class="dotted-line"></div><div class="conclace-heading"></div>

As of now, the ED would provide a written reply via email to Interpol. Later, if Interpol remains unsatisfied with the reply then it could send another set of queries on the concerned issues related to Mallya's case. If required, it could also seek hard copies of case details (including investigation reports). </p><p>Lalit Modi case is a classic and unusual example, where Interpol sent seven rounds of queries to ED, but still remained unsatisfied.</p><p>A day after the UK refused to deport Mallya, the ED requested the Interpol to issue a Red Corner Notice against the liquor baron. </p><p>A RCN is an international alert aimed at seeking the location and arrest of a person wanted by a judicial jurisdiction or an international tribunal with a view to his or her extradition. Once the said notice is issued, the Interpol seeks to arrest the person concerned in any part of the world and notifies that country to take his or her custody for further action at their end.</p><p>Sources told IndiaToday.in that within the month of June, the agency is planning to attach liquid assets of Mallya across the country. It includes - domestic assets and shares worth Rs 9000 crore owned by Mallya in connection with its money laundering probe against him and others in the IDBI Bank loan fraud case. <br /></p>]]></storybody>
