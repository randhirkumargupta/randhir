<storykicker><![CDATA[Comfort Food reveals a selection of the best recipes from one of Delhi's favourite restaurants.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>What Cafe Delhi Heights (CDH) did last evening is quite rare in the culinary world. In a market that is growing more and more competitive with the passing of time, guarding your trade secrets is the main focus for most restaurants, especially highly successful ones. A cookbook that reveals the recipes behind some of their best known dishes is never on the cards.</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p>But Cafe Delhi Heights' cookbook, Comfort Food,<i> </i>is exceptional. You'll find the recipe for the famous Juicy Lucy Burger nestled proudly in the second section and their Singaporean Laksa peeping out from the middle of the book. Photographs from the exquisite nooks and crannies of CDH's many branches form the perfect setting for the beautiful and evidently delicious recipes.</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cricket-party-easy-meals-food-world-cup-t20-2016-india/1/631834.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cricket-party-easy-meals-food-world-cup-t20-2016-india/1/631834.html"><u><b>Also read: Worry about the match, not the meals!</b></u></a>  <br /></p><p>You are bound to wonder why the owners, Sharad and Vikrant Batra, would want their recipes available at every bookstore with a culinary books section. The reason, for them, was quite simple: "We have taken the initiative to launch Comfort Food so that we take Cafe Delhi Heights' kitchen to each and every household. It is a tribute to Mom for all her hard work and guidance which has made Cafe Delhi Heights what it is today."</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p>It's a well-known fact that their mother Usha Batra is the inspiration behind Batra Banquets which turned into the even more successful CDH in 2009. For the cookbook, the owners relied upon two of the biggies in the industry--Michael Swamy and Mugdha Savkar--who have an awful lot of experience in styling food shoots and photographing food. Swamy explains: "Culinary trends get updated and outdated every few months... the only trend that never goes out of date is COMFORT. This book celebrates that very comfort." And what could be more comfortable than food inspired by mom's cooking?</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p>The guest of honour last evening, Virat Kohli, underlined the same concept during his speech. The cricketer who has made Delhi proud was there with his own mother, and related to us how he has known the Batras and the food they serve for years. "This is actually a family invitation. This has nothing to do with being a professional or any commercial interests."</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/the-newly-opened-caf%C3%A9-delhi-heights-is-a-hit-in-noida/1/680273.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/the-newly-opened-caf%C3%A9-delhi-heights-is-a-hit-in-noida/1/680273.html"><u><b>Also read: The newly opened Cafe Delhi Heights is a hit in Noida </b></u></a> <br /></p><p>The Kohli family used to visit Batra Banquets for family functions, where Virat first met the Batra brothers. "I had my mum there as well with me. And I have my mother today as well. But I'm the Chief Guest today, which is quite unbelievable." Mothers were the inspiration behind these successful people, whatever their field may be.</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p>The cookbook honours mothers and the comfort their cooking inspires. This inspiration, in the case of CDH, has been taken to a gourmet level which attracts the picky Delhi crowds. </p><p><i>Comfort Food: 80 easy-to-make recipes, by Michael Swamy and Mugdha Savkar, Om Books International (Price: Rs 995)</i></p><p>Watch Virat Kohli explain why he can't dig into a Juicy Lucy Burger, here: <br /></p><p><br /></p>
