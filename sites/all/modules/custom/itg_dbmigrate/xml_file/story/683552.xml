<storykicker><![CDATA[The Army does not allow any soldier to sport a permanent beard, except in the case of Sikhs. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A Muslim soldier terminated by the Indian Army for insisting on growing a beard on 'religious grounds', plans to move Supreme Court to challenge the order, an English daily reported.</p><p>According to a report by The Hindu, Maktumhusen, a 34-year-old Muslim soldier from Karnataka, was discharged and termed an 'undesirable soldier' over the issue.</p><p><b>HISTORY OF LEGAL TUSSLES</b></p><p>In 2001, Jawan Maktumhusen requested his Commanding Officer (CO) to allow him to grow a beard on religious grounds. After permitting him initially, the CO realised that the rules allow only Sikhs to sport permanent beards. Citing his findings, the CO withdrew the permission and asked Maktumhusen to comply.</p><p>The soldier called the order 'discriminatory' and moved Karnataka High Court, still refusing to shave off the beard.</p><p>He was then transferred to Command Hospital, Pune where his new CO also asked him to shave off the beard. Maktumhusen however, remained adamant.</p><p>A show-cause notice followed, after which he was sent on detention for disobedience for 14 days. As the Jawan continued to ignore instructions, he was discharged him from service and termed an 'undesirable soldier' after an inquiry.</p><p>According to his lawyers, Maktumhusen may move the Supreme Court.</p><p><b>WHAT THE RULES SAY</b></p><p>The Armed Forces do not allow any soldier to sport a permanent beard, except in the case of Sikhs.</p><p>The Army explains this is because having a beard is among their 'fundamental tenets'. Sikhism forbids its followers to cut hair - the religion believes by doing so they honour god's gift of hair.</p><p>"The Army is a disciplined force and denominational differences among its members based on religion, caste cannot be permitted. Practice of wearing a beard on the basis of religion by the applicant goes against Regulation 665 of the Defence Service Regulations and is not conducive to the discipline of the Force," said the Armed Forces Tribunal while terminating Maktumhusen.</p><p><b>DIFFERENT FORCE, DIFFERENT RULES</b></p><p>The Army, Navy and the Air force have different rules when it comes to facial hair. </p><p>The Army allows non-Sikhs to grow temporary beards only for soldiers in certain regiments and for covert operations - temporary being the operative word.</p><p>The Air Force does not allow any display of religious symbols on duty or at parades.</p><p>The Navy allows beards, but only with the CO's permission.</p><p>Some exceptions are only granted on medical grounds.</p><p>Sikhs, meanwhile, are permitted to keep untrimmed hair and a well-maintained beard across all services. <br /><b><br />MUSLIMS vs THE RULES</b></p><p>This is not the first time a Muslim jawan has kicked up a legal storm on the issue of growing beards.</p><p>In 2008, Aircraftsman Ansari Aftab Ahmed was discharged from service for demanding permission to grow a beard.</p><p>Four years after joining the IAF, he had sought permission to grow a beard. Denied, he went on 40 days' leave, and returned wearing a beard, said the IAF case file.</p><p>Around the same year, two more petitions were filed on the same issue -- one by IAF Corporal Mohammed Zubair and another by Maharashtra policeman Mohammad Fasi.</p><p>Interestingly, IAF allows Muslims who had a beard at the time of enrolment before January 1, 2002, to sport facial hair. They do have rules regarding its length and maintenance. </p><p><b>Bollywood Buzz</b></p><p>Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan is known to have angered the Army by sporting a beard in his role as an Army officer in the film Major Saab.</p><p>Actor Shah Rukh Khan also sported a beard in the film Jab Tak Hai Jaan but many officers in field areas in Kashmir are allowed beards for operational reasons.</p>]]></storybody>
