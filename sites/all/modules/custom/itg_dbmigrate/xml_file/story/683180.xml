<storykicker><![CDATA[Terming the killing of Congolese national Masonda Ketada Oliver in New Delhi last month as "barbaric", Swaraj had said "it was not a case of racial crime."]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has a recipe for good relations with Africa and its natives residing in India: shake hands and say 'India loves you' when you meet them next.</p><p>"I appeal to fellow Indians. Next time you meet an African citizen (sic), pl shake hand and say 'India loves you'. Pl RT," the 64-year-old Union minister tweeted today, days after she denied there is racism in India.</p><p><b>APPEAL AFTER DENYING RACISM </b></p><p>Terming the killing of Congolese national Masonda Ketada Oliver in New Delhi last month as "barbaric",<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/africans-attacked-in-india-sushma-swaraj-racial-discrimination/1/681657.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/africans-attacked-in-india-sushma-swaraj-racial-discrimination/1/681657.html"> Swaraj had said "it was not a case of racial crime."</a> </p><p>"India is the land of Gandhi and Buddha. We have fought consistently against racial discrimination. Mahatma Gandhi himself championed the cause of fighting against this evil. We can never have a racist mindset," she said.</p><p>"As a mother, I can understand the pain of a mother who loses a son on foreign soil. It would be a traumatic experience," Swaraj added.</p><p>The killing of the Congolese national and a string of other attacks on Africans staying in New Delhi, and a case of assault in Hyderabad has caused widespread anger among the community. </p><p>A group of African students held a protest at Jantar Mantar on Monday. As outrage grew, Swaraj met a delegation of African envoys and students in New Delhi on Tuesday and assured them of security.</p><p><b>GOA CM SAYS NIGERIANS "ANNOYING"</b></p><p>Meanwhile, notwithstanding Centre's damage-control efforts after the row over attack on African nationals, Goa Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Laxmikant Parsekar on Wednesday sparked fresh furore with his remark that <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/goa-cm-nigerians-attitude-attack-on-africans/1/682371.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/goa-cm-nigerians-attitude-attack-on-africans/1/682371.html">people in general are angry with Nigerians because of their "different attitude".</a> </p><p>"In general, people are angry with Nigerians and not other foreigners. I feel they (Nigerians) have a different attitude," Parsekar told PTI without elaborating. The BJP leader was responding to a question on recent allegations of rape against a Nigerian national in Goa and racial attacks in Delhi.</p><p>"We get people from all other countries, but in general the people of Goa are very much annoyed with their behaviour, attitude, their way of life...because on many occasions I hear complaints against Nigerians," said Parsekar.</p><p><b>Also Read:</b>&nbsp;</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/attack-on-africans-delhi-racism-media-hype/1/681136.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/attack-on-africans-delhi-racism-media-hype/1/681136.html">Attack on Africans: Racism or media hype?</a>&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/delhi-is-becoming-racist-delhi-hc-on-attacks-on-africans/1/682966.html " target="_blank">Delhi is becoming racist: Delhi HC on attacks on Africans</a> </b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
