<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The Prakash Committee, which was appointed to look into the role of officers of the civil administration and police during the Jat agitation, has exposed how the police officers supported the rioters and gave them a free hand to loot, riot and set ablaze public and private properties.</p><p><b>PRAKASH COMMITTEE'S REPORTS</b></p><p>The report, made public by the Haryana government on Tuesday, states that the national highway remained blocked between February 20 and 22 near Murthal. According to 'credible eyewitnesses,' several rioters riding motorcycles were allowed a free run. They terrorised and misbehaved with commuters, owners of several dhabas along the highway and burnt more than 50 vehicles with impunity.</p><p>As told to the Punjab and Haryana High Court by Amicus Curiae Anupam Gupta the report did mention the Murthal mass rapes. "On February 22, agitators set ablaze several vehicles parked near Sukhdev Dhaba, Murthal and harassed stranded commuters. They also reportedly misbehaved with some women," says the report.</p><p>The report also says on February 22, the district administration rescued about 400 vehicles which were trapped in various dhabas and restaurants near Murthal as NH 1 had been blocked by the rioters. The rioters, on the night of February 21 and 22, indulged in arson and looting near Sukhdev Dhaba and pelted stones at police. The committee has recommended exemplary disciplinary action against the DSP and SHO of Murthal police station.</p><p><b>WHEN POLICE FAILED </b><br /></p><p>"It is evident that DSP Satish Kumar and SHO Ajay Dhankar did not initiate any action against these miscreants. Exemplary disciplinary/departmental action should be taken against them so that it becomes a deterrent to all such officials who derelict from their duties and fail to protect the life and property of citizens," the report says. </p><p>Another reference to the mass rapes can be found on page 357. A resident of Kurad village, Bijender Singh, told the committee that anti-social elements came on motorcycles and had covered their faces. </p><p>They were fanned away by locals but returned on the intervening night of February 21 and 22 and torched about a dozen vehicles. "He gave shelter to one family in his house. There were victims of violence on GT Road. Their vehicles were burnt by the rioters on GT Road. He helped them leave for Delhi the next morning. He stated that he has the visiting cards of these victims," says the report.</p><p>Besides Singh, a doctor who owns a hotel at Murthal Chowk had told the committee that he had given shelter to 30 to 40 'victims of violence' in his hospital.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/murthal-gang-rape-naked-women-took-shelter-in-dhaba-says-reports/1/681338.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/murthal-gang-rape-naked-women-took-shelter-in-dhaba-says-reports/1/681338.html">Also read: Murthal rapes: Naked women took shelter in dhaba, say reports</a></b> </p>]]></storybody>
