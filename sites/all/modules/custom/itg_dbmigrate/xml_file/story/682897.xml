<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Anantnag constituency - the heart of PDP bastion South Kashmir - is headed for by-elections, posing the first test of popularity for the BJP-PDP alliance. Mehbooba Mufti will contest from the seat, which has been vacant since the death of her father Mufti Mohammad Syed.</p><p>The test is a crucial one for Mehbooba Mufti too -- some would call it a do or die situation. She needs to be elected for legislature within six months of her taking over as the chief minister. "I'm hopeful that people will repose faith in me and give me an opportunity to complete the work left by Mufti sahib," she said.</p><p><b>ALLIANCE BENEFITS OPPOSITION</b></p><p>On many occasions, Mufti herself has called the party's decision to ally with the BJP an unpopular one. She called it a necessity in light of people's mandate in the state. Her opponents, however, are using exactly this against her. </p><p>Congress candidate Hilal Shah had polled just 6000 votes lesser than Mufti Mohammad Syed in the 2014 Assembly elections. He believes the anger against PDP for its decision to ally with the BJP makes his job is easier this time. "They would ask votes from people last time saying they will keep RSS and BJP away, now they have joined hands with them only. People remember. It is going to be easier for me this time here," he said. </p><p>National Conference has also fielded its candidate in the constituency and they believe PDP's decision to be in power will have a huge impact on elections.</p><p>"They will have to answer for what they have done. They promised something else to the people and eventually gave them something else," said NC leader Ali Mohd Sagar, who was accompanying party candidate Iftikar Misgar during nomination-filing. </p><p><b>SECURITY CONCERNS</b></p><p>Conducting elections in South Kashmir is also going to be a major challenge for security forces and the administration. </p><p>The Election Commission will have to ensure violence free elections in light of growing militancy in south Kashmir. Anantnag has remained relatively calm compared to adjacent Kulgam and Pulwama areas, but the town has seen two grenade attacks in the last one month.</p>]]></storybody>
