<storykicker><![CDATA[On the first day of the 15th Tamil Nadu Assembly, DMK leader MK Stalin said he and his party will cooperate completely with the ruling AIADMK.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>"In a democracy ruling and opposition parties are two sides of the same coin. If one side was right and the other was mangled, it will become invalid," said Chief Minister <b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jayalalitaa-clarifies-on-seat-arrangement-no-intention-to-disrespect-stalin/1/676659.html">J Jayalalithaa</a></b>  quoting the Dravidian ideologue CN Annadurai, today. June 3, 2016, on the first day of the 15th Tamil Nadu Assembly, it was a moment of celebration for many. While the AIADMK had their second consecutive victory to rejoice, the DMK had their leader M Karunanidhi's 93rd birthday to celebrate. </p><p><b>P DHANAPAL ELECTED SPEAKER FOR 2ND CONSECUTIVE TERM</b> <br /></p><p>The Assembly session began with the unanimous election of the speaker - P Dhanapal. Dhanapal has the honour of becoming the first speaker to be elected for a consecutive second term in Tamil Nadu's legislative history. </p><p>Praising Jayalalithaa and her party for their hard-work and victory, Dhanpal opened the house. Further he assured that he will ensure a fair chance for all the parties during debate in the assembly. </p><p>While addressing the house, CM Jayalalithaa said that Dhanapal's re-election is reflective of his good work and said that he got this opportunity because of his, "competence, ability and experience." </p><p><b>WILL RESPECT CONSTRUCTIVE OPINIONS: JAYALALITHAA</b> <br /></p><p>Speaking about the open-mindedness and straightforward attitude of her party, Jayalalithaa said, "I can assure that we will respect the constructive opinions of the Opposition, seeing their views and how they reflect the people's views." During the session, Jaya also thanked the people of Tamil Nadu for having faith in her and her party and re-electing them for a second consecutive time and creating history. </p><p><b>DMK WILL COOPERATE GOVT COMPLETELY: STALIN </b><br /></p><p>M K Stalin, Leader of Opposition, after greeting Speaker Dhanapal and Deputy Speaker Jayaraman assured that he and his party will cooperate completely with the ruling party and said that the DMK and its allies were only Opposition party and not an enemy party. He also pointed out that the speaker should be neutral to all parties before concluding. </p><p>While Dhanapal has been elected as the Speaker (He is the first Dalit speaker after 1955) and Pollachi Jayaraman has been elected as the deputy speaker. </p><p>Dhanapal later adjourned the House to June 16.</p><p><b>ALSO READ</b>:&nbsp; <b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/post-poll-tamil-nadu-sees-the-rise-of-stalin/1/676046.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/post-poll-tamil-nadu-sees-the-rise-of-stalin/1/676046.html">Post-poll Tamil Nadu sees the rise of MK Stalin</a></b>  </p>]]></storybody>
