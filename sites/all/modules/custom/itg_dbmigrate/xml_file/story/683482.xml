Consult a dermatologist for proper evaluation and diagnosis of the condition. A doctor normally prescribes a medicated shampoo and few treatments for effective&nbsp; hair loss problems. </p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/you-are-exposed-to-harmful-chemicals-and-your-hair-and-nails-can-reveal-this-unhealthy-chemicals-plastic-human-milk-blood-urine/1/610875.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/you-are-exposed-to-harmful-chemicals-and-your-hair-and-nails-can-reveal-this-unhealthy-chemicals-plastic-human-milk-blood-urine/1/610875.html"><b>Also read:</b> <b>You are exposed to harmful chemicals and your hair and nails can reveal this</b></a> <br /></p><p>Listed below are two such medical treatments that you may want to choose for treating your hair-loss woes.</p><p><b>Laser hair therapy: </b>Laser therapy treatment helps to increase healthy hair by 73 per cent with no side-effects. This therapy comprises of a hair mask which is combined with patented cold light sources and pure oxygen. This laser light penetrates through your scalp and leaves you with healthy, happy strands. The treatment is said to be extremely effective when it comes to treating hair loss. &nbsp;</p><p><b>PRP treatment (Platelet Rich Plasma Plus):</b> PRP contains special cells called platelets, that can theoretically cause growth of the hair follicles by stimulating the stem cells and other cells in the microenvironment of the hair follicle. The primary purpose of using PRP in hair restoration is to stimulate inactive or newly implanted hair follicles into an active growth phase. PRP plus is again a holistic approach towards initial non-surgical hair restoration.</p>]]></storybody>
