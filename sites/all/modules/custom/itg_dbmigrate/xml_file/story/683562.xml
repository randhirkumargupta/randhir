<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Book binder's son has topped the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE) in MBA leaving the academic fraternity in his town proud. His father, Sk. Fallauddin, was forced to sell off a piece of urban land to meet son's study expenses.<br /></p><p>Shadab Anwar, who is a graduate in Commerce from Kendrapara Autonomous College, secured first in OJEE-MBA.<br /></p><p><b>Proud Principal of Kendrapara autonomous college supports the boy: </b></p><p>Sachidanand Sadangi, principal of Kendrapara autonomous college said, "It's a matter of pride for our college. The highlight of Anwar's achievement is that he hailed from a family with a modest income." <br /></p><p><b>Fallauddin, the father of the topper, says;</b></p><p>"Anwar was good at studies. He had excelled in 10th standard, plus two and plus three examination. I have another younger son and daughter. I was forced to sell off a decimal of land in Kendrapara town to meet with their academic expenses. With Anwar's achieving top rank in joint entrance examination, I feel I did not commit a mistake in selling the land," said his father Fallauddin. </p><p><b>From the topper's desk: </b><br /></p><p>Anwar said, "There is no short-cut to success. I was very sincere towards studies. It has borne fruit. Topping entrance has inspired me for achieving greater heights. I have set my target to excel in MBA and get a good job. My father is very supportive." <br /></p><p>Despite his limited income, monetary constraints never prevented him from perusing higher education, he said.<br /></p><p><b>Pat on his back&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p><p> Bhagaban Jena, educationist and retired teacher of Kendrapara autonomous college, said, "Anwar's success is inspirational given the fact that he hails from minority community. People from minority community here are lagging behind in education front. Still Anwar with parental support has set an example for people from his community."<br /></p><p><b>Read: <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/isef/1/678957.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/isef/1/678957.html">Exclusive!
