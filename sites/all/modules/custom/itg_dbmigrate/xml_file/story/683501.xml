<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Test teams are excessively exploiting 'home advantage' by preparing pitches that favour the strengths of the host nation, an International Cricket Council (ICC) panel representing various stakeholders within the sport said on Friday.</p><p>India manipulated conditions to thump South Africa 3-0 last year amid dissatisfaction over the nature of the turning tracks used in the series, including the strip in Nagpur which was rated 'poor' by match referee Jeff Crowe. </p><p>The ICC Cricket Committee, headed by former India captain Anil Kumble, is unhappy with the quality of test pitches "and in particular the common practice of home countries overtly preparing surfaces to suit their own teams".</p><p>The panel was also worried about the growing imbalance between bat and ball and has requested the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodians of the game's laws, to curb the use of oversized bats. (<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/icc-cricket-committee-cricket-bats-mcc-icc-helmets-concussion-substitutes/1/683492.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/icc-cricket-committee-cricket-bats-mcc-icc-helmets-concussion-substitutes/1/683492.html"><b>ICC plans crackdown on bat size</b></a>)</p><p>"The Committee received a research paper from MCC citing a wealth of scientific and statistical evidence showing bats have become more powerful in recent years, primarily due to having larger 'sweet-spots'.</p><p>"The committee's view was that MCC should strongly consider limiting the dimensions of cricket bats to help achieve a better balance between bat and ball."</p><p>During the two-day meeting which concluded at Lord's on Wednesday, ICC medical consultant Craig Ranson made a presentation to the panel on injury surveillance trends.</p><p>The committee recommended toughening helmet standards, an issue that has assumed more importance following Australian batsman Phillip Hughes' death in 2014 after being struck in the head by a bouncer.</p><p>"The committee expressed concerns that there were still too many instances of international cricketers wearing helmets which did not meet the latest British Safety Standard (BSS)," it said.</p><p>"It recommended that the ICC should enforce the wearing of the latest BSS compliant helmets in all international cricket."</p><p>Comprising representatives of various interested associates, the panel makes recommendations to the ICC Chief Executives' Committee and the ICC Board for approval.<br /></p><p><b>DAY-NIGHT TESTS</b></p><p>There were discussions on how day-night Test cricket could be spread keeping all the checks and balances.</p><p>"It stressed, however, that day-night Test cricket needs to be delivered to a consistently high standard across all member countries if the concept is to be successful, noting that the combination of ball, pitch, lighting levels and environmental conditions needed to allow for an even contest between bat and ball at all proposed day-night Test venues," stated the release.</p><p><b>FUTURE USE OF TECHNOLOGY <br /></b><br />The ICC Cricket Committee had a long discussion about the future use of technology in international cricket, and particularly umpiring, after receiving a presentation from the MIT engineers on their testing of the current technologies used as part of the Decision Review System (DRS).</p><p>"The presentation covered the performance of edge-detection systems (both heat-based and sound-based systems), and ball-tracking with predictive path, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each type of technology, and how each could contribute to increasing the number of correct decisions made across international matches," he said.</p><p>A detailed report, along with a list of recommended changes to DRS protocols will be finalised over coming weeks and presented to the ICC Chief Executives' Committee and Board meetings at the end of June.</p><p>(With inputs from agencies)</p>]]></storybody>
