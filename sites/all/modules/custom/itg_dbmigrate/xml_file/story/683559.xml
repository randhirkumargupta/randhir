<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Following the outbreak of mob violence in Mathura in which two senior police officials lost their lives apart from 22 civilians, the entire district remains under strict police vigil and a state of tension-filled peace prevails there.</p><p><b>INTELLIGENCE FAILURE? </b><br /></p><p>In the aftermath of the incident, questions are being raised on why the police and administration continued to ignore the assembly of over 3000 armed civilians in the Jawahar Bagh compound since the past 30 months, a negligence which resulted in such a disaster.</p><p>Talking to India Today on this matter, UP Director General of Police Javeed Ahmed said that 22 rioters died in the violence apart from the Station House Officer of Farah and Superintendant of Police Mathura City. Out of the 22, 11 died in the fire that the rioters had set to their own shacks built inside the compound, while 11 died in the police lathicharge subsequent to a blatant attack on the police force by the rioters from all sides.</p><p>He said that the rioters had accumulated massive volume of arms, ammunition and other types of bladed weapons and a tunnel inside the compound still contained a large number of bombs and grenades so that section of the compound has been cordoned off by the police as attempts are being made to defuse the bombs.</p><p><b>PROBE ORDERED</b> <br /></p><p>UP Principal Secretary (Home) Debashish Panda said that the inquiry of the incident has been deputed to the Agra divisional commissioner Pradeep Bhatnagar.</p><p>Spread in 280 acres of horticulture department land, the Jawaharbagh incident could easily become the nail in the coffin for the Samajwadi Party as local BJP leaders are alleging that Ramvriksh Yadav, the leader of this ragtag army of rioters had close association with a senior Samajwadi Party leader and UP Cabinet minister and it was the minister's protection that allowed the so-called Satyagrahis to capture valuable horticultural land and squat on it for almost three years and no action was taken on them.</p><p><b>SAFE HAVEN FOR&nbsp; MAOISTS?</b><br /></p><p>Sources indicated that the compound also acted as a shelter for several Maoists who had disappeared over the past couple of years in Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar and they had provided training to the rioters for combating the police force effectively. Several of the so-called Satyagrahis have dozens of criminal cases registered against them.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-clash-1-policeman-killed-several-others-injured-during-anti-encroachment-drive/1/683369.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-clash-1-policeman-killed-several-others-injured-during-anti-encroachment-drive/1/683369.html">1 policeman killed, several others injured during anti-encroachment drive in Mathura</a></b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
