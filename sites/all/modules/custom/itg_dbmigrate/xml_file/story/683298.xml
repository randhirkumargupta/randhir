<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Days after the bodies of 40 tiger cubs were discovered in a freezer, Thai authorities charged three Buddhist monks on Thursday after they were caught trying to smuggle tiger skins and charms made from tiger parts out a temple which monks said was a tiger sanctuary but critics said was a money-spinning tourist trap.</p><p>The Buddhist temple west of Bangkok has long been popular with tourists who paid about $20 each to get in and pose for pictures with its tigers, and to feed cubs and walk among them.</p><p><b>ILLICIT WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING SUSPECTED</b> <br /></p><p>But the temple had come under mounting allegations of abuse and illicit wildlife trafficking and authorities armed with a court order raided it on Monday to confiscate the 137 tigers found there and take them to a government wildlife sanctuary.</p><p>The discovery on Thursday of the tiger skins and charms, or amulets, made from skins in a pick-up truck, and jars containing the bodies of tiger cubs in the temple, pointed to an even more lucrative business than thought.</p><p>"The jars have labels, so I think they've made medicine here," said Adisorn Nuchdamrong, deputy director-general of the Department of National Parks, who has been overseeing the raid to remove the temple's tigers and search its premises.</p><p>Authorities found 20 glass jars containing baby tigers and tiger organs in a "laboratory" in the temple, reinforcing suspicion it was making folk medicine, he said.</p><p><b>TIGERS IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE </b><br /></p><p>Tiger parts are used in traditional Chinese medicine, a multi-million dollar business that has driven tigers in the wild to the brink of extinction and fueled the rearing of tigers in parts of Asia, especially in China.</p><p>"We will discover more as we search on," Adisorn told Reuters.</p><p>Two temple devotees and a monk found in the pick-up truck, and two monks who helped load it, were charged under wildlife laws, Adisorn said. Representatives of the temple were not available for comment.</p><p>The confiscation of the tiger products followed the discovery on Wednesday of 40 dead tiger cubs in a freezer.</p><p>Wildlife officials suspect the cubs were being preserved for use in potions.</p><p>Thailand is well known as a hub for illicit trafficking of wildlife products, including ivory.</p><p>Activists had for years criticised the temple and urged tourists to shun it, and complained that wildlife protection laws were poorly enforced.</p><p>The Department of National Parks had removed 84 out of the 137 tigers found at the temple by Thursday.</p><p>Workers have been using tranquiliser darts to sedate the animals before lifting them into cages and on to trucks for the journey to the government sanctuary.</p><p><b>ALSO READ:&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/40-dead-tiger-cubs-found-in-thai-temple-freezer-key-developments/1/682356.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/40-dead-tiger-cubs-found-in-thai-temple-freezer-key-developments/1/682356.html">40 dead tiger cubs found in Thai temple freezer: Key developments</a></b> <br /></p>]]></storybody>
