bilateral talks, India's most wanted Hafiz Saeed led a march on the 
streets of Islamabad raising anti-USA and India slogans.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Two of India's most wanted terrorists in Pakistan have once again come out in public after the killing of Taliban chief Mullah Mansour. On one hand, Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of Mumbai terror attacks and chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa led a huge anti-US/India march in Islamabad today, whereas the chief of banned organisation Jaish-e-Mohammad, Maulana Masood Azhar released an audio message against killing of Taliban chief. The message is from a piece written by Azhar and recorded in one of his closest associates' voice. Azhar recalled the role of former Taliban chief in his release from Indian jail after IC814 hijacking incident. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>HAFIZ SAEED'S OPEN DARE AGAINST US AND INDIA</b></p><p>At a time when PM Narendra Modi is about to visit US for bilateral talks, India's most wanted Hafiz Saeed led a march on the streets of Islamabad raising anti-US and India slogans. In a massive show of strength, this march was organised against killing of Taliban chief in US led drone attack inside Pakistan.</p><p>Hafiz Saeed has been attending rallies in Lahore, Islamabad and other cities of Pakistan but this is probably for the first time that the chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa led an open march in Pakistan's capital against US and India. &nbsp;</p><p>"US has declared an open war against Pakistan, this is the toughest time for Pakistan since 1971" said Hafiz Saeed. "If any more drones or missiles attack a Pakistani target or a nuclear facility then by God's grace we have enough drones to strike each city of your's" threatened Hafiz Saeed. This was followed by anti-India slogans such as "Bharat ki barbadi tak jung rahegi".</p><p>Commenting about India-Iran relationship, Hafiz said that Chabahar is one of the biggest attacks against Pakistan and it is their duty to protect China sponsored Gwadar route.</p><p><b>MASOOD AZHAR'S MESSAGE ON KILLING OF TALIBAN CHIEF &nbsp;</b><br />&nbsp;<br />In his latest message, banned terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad's chief Maulana Masood Azhar has paid a tribute to Taliban chief Mullah Mansour. The tape is from a&nbsp; piece written by Jaish chief Azhar and recorded by Maulana Talha Al-Saif, one of the closest associates of Maulana Masood Azhar. Azhar who is believed to be the mastermind of several terrorist attacks in India, including 2001 Parliament attack and recent attack on Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, called the Taliban chief the greatest martyr of recent history and threatened the enemies with dire consequences. "Enemies have played their part, now it is time for Muslims to give a firm reply, the world will see something spectacular" said Azhar. Even though Pakistan government has officially announced that Masood Azhar is being kept in preventive custody, the chief of banned outfit continues to dare Pakistan government by delivering hate messages through JeM's mouthpiece Al-Qalam and such audio messages.</p><p>Azhar also recalled his association with the former Taliban chief. He recalled a meeting with former Taliban chief Mansour (who was the minister for civil aviation during Taliban rule when the infamous hijacking of IC814 took place), "I was once invited by Taliban to Kandhar with a delegation from Karachi, Mullah Mansour came to receive me and took us to VIP lounge. He asked me to be seated on a sofa, he suddenly started laughing and told me that it was the same sofa where Jaswant Singh sat on when he escorted you to Kandhar, Jaswant Singh made an offer to Taliban government to return Azhar and others for a huge amount of money".</p><p>The original transcript of this message by JeM chief was also published in JeM's mouthpiece Al-Qalam. Azhar also called the current Pakistani government lead by PM Nawaz Sharif, one of the weakest in recent history.</p>]]></storybody>
