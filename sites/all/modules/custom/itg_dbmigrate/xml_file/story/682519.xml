<storybody><![CDATA[<p>As the UP assembly elections are closing in, the BJP is changing tack, gearing up to treat the Samajwadi Party as its main opponent instead of the Bahujan Samaj Party.</p><p>Till a few weeks back, the BJP was following the policy of treating the BSP as its principal opponent, but with the Modi government completing two years in power, the party is ready for a face-off with the SP.</p><p><b>MUSLIM VOTES A KEY FACTOR</b></p><p>When India Today spoke to the local political analysts and prominent citizens, the equation of Muslim votes came up as the reason behind the BJP's changed stance. Senior citizen Rama Shanker Sharma said that the BJP seems to have made an electoral agenda to rope in as many Muslim voters as possible before the elections and by showing itself as the primary opponent of the SP, it hoped to gain the Muslim voters who had become disenchanted from the SP.</p><p>This way, he said, the BJP is also burrowing in the Muslim voters of the BSP as Mayawati is hoping to gain a lot of mileage in these elections through Dalit and Muslim vote polarisation. If any Muslim voters of the BSP leave the party's fold, they are bound to fall into the lap of the BJP as the SP is fast losing the sympathies of this community, while Modi's inclusive politics was gaining the support of Muslims, although the number was still quite insignificant.</p><p><b>BJP NOT PLAYING HINDUTVA CARD</b></p><p>He said that although the firebrand leaders of the BJP are active in Hindu majority areas, the party is not focusing on Hindutva agenda and instead, it was projecting development as its main agenda, which was evident from all the speeches Modi had given till date, where the BJP's erstwhile communal agenda was sidelined by development.</p><p>However, he said, the Muslim voters have been indoctrinated to oppose the right-wing BJP and their votes usually go in the favour of the candidate who they believe, can defeat the BJP. If the SP candidate appears weak, the Muslim votes could go en-masse to the BSP candidate, spoiling the BJP's electoral math.</p><p>All India Hindustani Biradari Secretary Ziauddin said that the BJP hopes that by portraying itself as the principal contender against SP, it could prevent the complete polarisation of Muslim votes in favour of the BSP and will increase its voter base through windfall Muslim votes.</p><p>A local BJP leader claimed that the party high command had already divided the state into six divisions and the divisional task forces had been assigned the task of making a detailed study of the regional problems in their respective divisions and prepare an electoral strategy based on that. The high command has also instructed to prevent the polarisation of Muslim votes in the favour of the SP or the BSP. He said that this election will ascertain the political future of both Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati, both of whom had laid high stakes in anticipation of these elections.</p><p><b>Also read:</b></p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/uttar-pradesh-elections-samajwadi-party-mulayam-singh-yadav/1/682127.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/uttar-pradesh-elections-samajwadi-party-mulayam-singh-yadav/1/682127.html">Ahead of 2017 elections in UP, storm brews in Samajwadi cup</a> </b><br />&nbsp;<br /></p>]]></storybody>
