<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Fidra Mehtab and her husband Mohammed Umar Anjum were happy with the birth of their first child. Born healthy, Aayan Anjum soon became the reason for their living. But three months after he was born, the couple realised that their son was not responding to any sound or noise around him. They also realised that his interaction with the outside world became minimal post the viral attack.&nbsp;</p><p>"He had recovered from a viral fever and after that, he was not responding to any sound. We got worried and took him to every famous doctor around us," said his mother Fidra.&nbsp;</p><p><b>'DAMAGE WAS SO DEEP'</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Hailing from Pakistan, the family kept running from pillar to post but none of the doctors assured a 100 per cent cure for their son. Eventually, some of the tests reflected a&nbsp;profound loss of hearing in both the ears. In addition to this, the shocked parents were informed that the damage was so deep that even hearing aids could not bring back their child's hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>"We searched the Internet to find the best doctors around the world to treat our son. Doctors here were not sure about the results," said boy's father Mohammed Umar. The family then decided to fly down to India for Aayan's treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing their distraught state, consultants in Pakistan and the neighbours helped them cross the border and come to Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket. "When the family came to us they were really worried. All they wanted to know was about the hearing loss of their son. They wanted him to be perfectly fine. The cost of treatment in Pakistan is 50 per cent higher than India," said Dr Sumit Mrig, senior consultant and head of the&nbsp;department, ENT, Max Hospital Saket.</p><p>'<b>IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT'</b></p><p>Dr Mrig in the last six years has treated 160 hearing loss patients from all over the world, out of which three were from Pakistan. An external processor was implanted in the kid's ear, giving the patient his ability to hear back. He was operated on May 23 and is responding to sound. He was put under a planned process called 'SWITCH ON'.&nbsp;</p><p>"The surgery was successful and our child was responding to all the noises around him. It was an emotional moment for us. We were thankful to the god and to the doctors for treating our son," said Fidra.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that the traumatic episode does not deter Aayan's growth in any manner, he will undergo speech therapy for a period of six months to a year. Post which, he will be back at home to attend school and enjoy his childhood with all his abilities intact.</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/government-to-change-law-give-hindus-from-pakistan-home/1/682161.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/government-to-change-law-give-hindus-from-pakistan-home/1/682161.html">Also read: </a><a target="_blank">Government to provide hassle-free Indian citizenship to Pakistani Hindus</a></b>  </p>]]></storybody>
