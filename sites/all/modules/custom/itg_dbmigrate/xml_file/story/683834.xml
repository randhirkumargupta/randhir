<storykicker><![CDATA[At the entry of Jawaharbagh, we saw that around 15 cars were burnt completely. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>When you take a right turn from the road to the SP's office in Mathura, it takes you to the gate of Jawaharbagh Udyan. Once you reach the gate, you are greeted with slogans written on either sides. While one side mentions "Azad hind ki sena aa gayi hai Jawaharbagh Udyan mein 15 March se", the other side reads "Azad hind sarkar zindabad".</p><p>Welcome to the world of Ramvriksh Yadav- a man with over 250 acres of place right in the middle of the Mathura city with around 3,000 followers. The story of Ramvriksh Yadav is bizarre, so audacious that it might appear as though you are watching a Hindi film with an overboard villain with powerful political connection.</p><p><b>INSIDE RAMVRIKSH YADAV'S KINGDOM</b></p><p>Today we got a glimpse of what was inside Ramvriksh Yadav's kingdom. As you enter, you realise what the police was up against when it entered the Jawaharbagh to evict the cult of "Bose" as it's founder Ramvriksh Yadav would have called. Every thing was burned down. From cars to fans to coolers to grains to even trees, everything was burned by them to keep the police away. Almost 10 meters inside the garden, on your left is a big hoarding outlining the ethos of the cult calling itself "Azad Bharat Vidhik Vaicharik Kranti Satyagrahi". With instructions from how powerful the Indian currency was with pictures of British currency to prophecies by Nastradamus about impending revolution which will bring glorious years of India after revolution, this was a clear indicator of how the mind of Ramvriksh Yadav worked.</p><p>At the entry of Jawaharbagh, we saw that around 15 cars were burnt completely. The impact of the fire was such that several trees were also completely burnt. As we went ahead we saw how godowns where rice and grains were kept were burned in order to keep away police as burning food stock resulted in cloud of smoke. Even the LPG cylinders were detonated to keep away police from entering. As we entered a completely burnt kitchen, we say utensils and several other burned kitchen appliances.</p><p>In the second room adjoining kitchen, there were close to 75-80 small cylinders and around 10 LPG cylinders. It was enough indication of what would have happened if these cylinders too would have caught fire. Ramvriksh Yadav's&nbsp; quarter was at the extreme far right of the park and he had converted the office of Udyan into his own room. It was set in an extremely scenic view with a lake next to it but today it was all burned down. The lake was an artificially created one which he built when water connection was cut off. There is also a temple next to his house.</p><p>The extent of his megalomania was such that he had constructed a stage which he used to call sansad (Parliament) with speakers on almost every corner of Jawaharbagh. Police say that when they tried to evict them, Ramvriksh Yadav had used this sansad to tell his followers about the police attack.</p><p><b>HOW THE POLICE WAS ATTACKED</b></p><p>When we visited the backside of the Jawaharbagh, we saw the broken wall from where the police led by SP Mukul Dwivedi and SHO Santosh Yadav had tried entering. Constable Ajit Dube told us how they were ambushed in gorilla style by Ramvriksh Yadav's gang. As the police entered, they opened fire while simealtnaeously attacking SP, resulting in death of both officers.</p><p>Ramvriksh Yadav had loaded over this huge Jawaharbagh Udyan for almost 2 and a half years with his near maniacal ideologies but today, after 4 days of the encounter, his kingdom, like we see in the movies, was literally burned down. Though the kingdom of Ramvriksh Yadav has been brought down, important question of his political affiliation and how he was able to run it for so long still remains unanswered.</p>]]></storybody>
