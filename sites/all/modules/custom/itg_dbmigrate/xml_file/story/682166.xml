<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Schemes under financial inclusion like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna, Atal Pension Yojna and many insurance schemes has emerged as major achievements of the Modi government as it celebrates two years in office. All these schemes have received all round applause as it empowers people of lower income group financially. Earlier, many people living in rural belts used to hesitate visiting banks and opening an account.</p><p> But, the number tells the success story of these schemes. Over 22 crore people have opened their bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojna. Similarly, 9.43 crore people have taken policies of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna and 2.96 crore people have enrolled for Jivan Jyoti Bima Yojna. The account holders are poor and most live in far flung rural areas. These social security schemes have come out as great ways to secure the lives of marginalised people.</p><p>Similarly, introduced in 2014, the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojna has by far come out as one of the best conservative debt investment schemes available for parents with daughters below 10 years. At 8.6 per cent, the scheme gives the highest returns among all small savings instruments.</p><p><b>Making a difference</b></p><p>Programmes such as Startup India and Skill India aiming to provide entrepreneurship and trained working forces are expected to deliver long-term gains for the country. On the occasion of completion of two years of inclusive growth and development under the current government, Union Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (Independent Charge) Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that more than 1.04 crore youth have been trained under the Skill India Mission in the year 2015-16 which is 36.8% higher than the previous year's recorded data.</p><p>The government will bring a law to set up National Board for Skills Assessment and Certification (NBSAC) to ensure quality skill training. Rudy said currently there is no common board for assessment and certification purposes. "We are creating one act for NBSAC. This will be a big step forward as there would be a common assessment and certification board, he said while briefing the media about the performance of his ministry," he added.</p><p>On the other side, many people employed in unorganised sectors, including plumbers, electrician, motor-mechanics are of the view that certificate or training is hardly needed as they get on the job training without spending any money. But, many others praised the government scheme saying that getting a certificate from a recognised institute is necessary to get a job in some private companies. They said that there is huge demand of skilled workers in big cities and the government's scheme has offered them various choices of getting training and certificates from institutes spread all across the country.</p><p>Similarly, Startup India which has been launched only a few months ago has also started receiving responses from budding entrepreneurs with complaints that the registration process is not simple as finding an incubator is not an easy job for all.&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
