<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Debutant filmmaker Raam Reddy's Kannada feature Thithi is creating waves in India after winning a National Award and various honours at prestigious film festivals such as Locarno, Marrakech and Palm Springs. <b><br /></b><br />Bollywood maverick Anurag Kashyap hosted a special screening in Mumbai on Monday evening. Among headturners at the do was Kangana Ranaut, who struck killer poses in denim shorts, offshoulder white top and designer flats. Her Tanu Weds Manu coactor Swara Bhaskar appeared more traditional in shimmering ethnic wear. Actors Gulshan Devaiah, Rahul Bhat and Kartik Aaryan were on the guest list too, as were composer Amit Trivedi, and filmmakers Shekhar Kapur and Sudhir Mishra.<br /></p><p><b>PLUS POINTS</b><br /> </p><p>"I enjoyed the film and I think it is very unusual for Indian cinemagoers. So, please go watch it and have fun," Kangana said after the show. For Swara, the film was reminiscent of the best in Hindi literature. "Thithi reminded me of Premchand's stories. This is the first Kannada film I have seen and it was quite a phenomenal work," she said. </p><p>Kashyap, who is readying his psycho thriller Raman Raghav 2.0, said Thithi was set for all-India release on June 3 with English subtitles. "Saw Thithi the 4th time and it was funnier than before. I envy this Ram Reddy, how do you make non actors act so well (sic)?" tweeted @anuragkashyap72 after the show. The USP of Thithi is Reddy has made the film entirely with a non-professional cast. </p><p>The film is a satire set in a remote South Indian village, and tells how three descendents react after a 101-year-old man named Century Gowda passes away, when they meet at the departed man's 'thithi', or final day of rituals 11 days after the death. For Shekhar Kapur, the film's beauty lay in observational details. "It is difficult to make such observational films. Sometimes I wonder how people write these scripts," he said. "It is so gently and beautifully told," said filmmaker Sudhir Mishra. For Masaan hero Vicky Kaushal, Thithi was a "great experience".</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/thithi-watch-the-funny-deep-and-engaging-trailer-of-national-award-winning-film/1/646961.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/thithi-watch-the-funny-deep-and-engaging-trailer-of-national-award-winning-film/1/646961.html">Also read: Thithi: Watch the funny, deep and engaging trailer of the National Award-winning film</a> </b></p>]]></storybody>
