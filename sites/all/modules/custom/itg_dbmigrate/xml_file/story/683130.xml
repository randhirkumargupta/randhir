<storybody><![CDATA[<p>No one else could have made a major mockery of the legal system recently in Tamil Nadu like the way Yuvraj, the leader of a right wing caste outfit did so. A prime suspect in the murder of Gokulraj, a dalit boy had little concern about the law.</p><p>Gokulraj, was found headless next to a railway track on June 24, 2015. Eyewitnesses cliamed to have seen the boy with a upper caste Hindu girl on June 23 next to a temple, chatting together. That evening, Gokulraj was supposedly abducted by Yuvraj's men and was allegedly roughed up for talking to a upper caste girl. Yuvraj blatantly agreed that his men warned him of consequences of talking to the girl and left him there. Gokulraj's family found a headless body of their beloved son, next to a train track, the next day.</p><p><b>110 DAYS SEARCH</b> <br /></p><p>A case under Goondas Act was filed against Yuvraj, and the mighty Tamilnadu Police began a search of Yuvraj which lasted for 110 days. In the mean time, Yuvraj released audiotapes and lived without fear in an incognito mode. To add fuel to the flame, Vishnupriya, a DSP who was investigating the murder of Gokulraj, committed suicide. Her death note did not blame anyone but indirectly shamed Tamilnadu Polce force as more skeletons began tumbling out of the closet.</p><p>The discrepancy did not end there, Yuvraj released call recordings between himself and DSP Vishnupriya, discussing the details of the case and pressure from senior police officers. Yuvraj was able to video chat with a couple of regional channels about the death of a police officer and yet the cops couldn't nab this prime suspect. Yuvraj kind of believed that he was Robin Hood of the south.</p><p><b>SURRENDER DRAMA</b> <br /></p><p>Finally, Yuvraj decided to surrender to the cops on October 11, 2015. The murder suspect entered Namakkal CB-CID office, with hundreds of his followers and media recording the incident. An irritated official recalled how he surrendered in style and the officials had to welocme him like a hero.</p><p>Yuvraj was arrested under Goondas Act, but for six months cops made no progress in the case. Though they claimed earlier that the case was very strong as they found evidence of Gokulraj's belongings in Yuvraj's car, nothing was done to fortify the case.</p><p>Finally, Yuvraj pleaded to the Madras High Court, seeking a quash on the Goondas Act over his head. As there was no progress in the case, the court abided and quashed it. Following which Yuvraj got conditional bail and was released yesterday from Vellore prison.</p><p>He received a hero's welcome, his community men wearing the red and green towels to distinguish themselves, praised Yuvraj and called him a saviour of the Gounder society. Right in front of the prison's gate, Yuvraj spoke to the press and claimed that Gokulraj committed murder and Thiruchengode DSP Vishnupriya was forced to commit suicide and that he also possessed evidence for whatever he said.</p><p>Yuvraj is free on bail.</p>]]></storybody>
