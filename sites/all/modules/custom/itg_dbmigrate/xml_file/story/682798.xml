<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Batting star Virat Kohli's childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma believes the Indian Test captain is very much capable of breaking Sachin Tendulkar's records with the way he has been batting. (<a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/ipl2016/" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/ipl2016/"><b>Full IPL Coverage</b></a>)<br /><b><br />'SUBLIME FORM'</b></p><p>Sharma doesn't see a weakness in Kohli's batting, which has reached the next level with sensational performances in the World T20 and subsequent Indian Premier League. (<a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/virat-kohli-ms-dhoni-ravi-shastri-india-captain-india-coach-ipl-2016/1/680975.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/virat-kohli-ms-dhoni-ravi-shastri-india-captain-india-coach-ipl-2016/1/680975.html"><b>Virat Kohli should replace MS Dhoni as India captain in ODIs, T20Is: Ravi Shastri</b></a>)<br /></p><p>"He is in sublime form at the moment. I don't remember anyone playing for India being as consistent as Kohli. Even internationally, there won't be many who have shown the consistency Kohli has shown. With the way he is batting, he is very much capable of breaking Sachin's records," Sharma, who watched Kohli lead RCB in the IPL final in Bengaluru on Sunday, said on Wednesday.</p><p>There has been no looking back for Kohli ever since the forgettable tour of England in 2014 when he failed to make a single half century in five Tests. He soon ironed out the flaws in his game and went to hammer four hundreds in the subsequent four-Test series in Australia.</p><p><b>TRANSFORMATION</b></p><p>Talking more about Kohli's transformation, Sharma said: "What separates him from the rest is the self belief in his ability. He backs his ability and the way he adapts to different conditions against different opposition is very good and it is a very important reason why he is successful. And he is always hungry for runs."</p><p>"England tour was a bad patch and every player goes through that phase. After that, he worked very hard on his game and the result of that you saw in Australia, the World T20 and now the IPL," he said.<br /><b><br />FITNESS FREAK</b></p><p>Apart from his astonishing batting, Kohli is also one of the best fielders in world cricket at present. Sharma said it has happened because Kohli follows a strict diet chart and spends substantial amount of time at the gym.</p><p>"He prepares very well. Hard work everyone does but he does smart work with hard work. For example, everyone goes back to their rooms after practice but he goes back and spends an hour or two in the gym. He has strict control over his diet even though he is very much a foodie. He eats only boiled and grilled stuff along with fruits. He loves to eat. It is just that he is avoiding fats and sugar," he said.<br /><b><br />CONTROLLED AGGRESSION</b></p><p>Kohli has also toned down his aggression with time and his coach feels it has only helped India's batting mainstay.</p><p>"Aggression has always been his strength. The only thing is that he should not be over aggressive and cross the line. He was a bit immature earlier but now he is a matured guy, and what you are seeing on the field these days is controlled aggression. He has got a very good head on his shoulders." </p><p>Sharma closely followed Kohli's breathtaking run in IPL where he ended up being the highest run-getter besides smashing a record four centuries.</p><p>"I was in regular touch with Virat. I even went to watch the final and got back only a couple of days ago. The hundred he made against Kings XI in the 15-over game is my personal favourite. It was unbelievable the way he played that night." </p><p><b>READY TO CAPTAIN IN ALL FORMATS</b></p><p>Sharma feels Kohli is ready to captain in all three formats but he should wait as long as MS Dhoni is around. <span itemprop="articleBody">(<a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sourav-ganguly-sports-show/1/664116.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sourav-ganguly-sports-show/1/664116.html"><b>Sourav Ganguly raises questions on MS Dhoni's future as India captain</b></a>)</span></p><p>"He has shown his leadership quality but I would say Dhoni is a tremendous captain. So let him continue till the time he wants to continue and Virat will take over when the times comes," he said. <br /></p>]]></storybody>
