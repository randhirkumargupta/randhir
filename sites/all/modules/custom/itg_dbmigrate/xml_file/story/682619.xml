<storybody><![CDATA[<p>India's biggest pro-boxing star Vijender Singh is unlikely to feature at the Rio Olympics 2016 despite the international boxing association AIBA allowing professional boxers to compete at the Games. (<a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rio-olympics-2016-rio-games-boxing-aiba-pro-boxing-vijender-singh/1/682445.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rio-olympics-2016-rio-games-boxing-aiba-pro-boxing-vijender-singh/1/682445.html"><b>Boxing body votes to let top pros fight at Rio Olympics</b></a>)</p><p><b>LANDMARK RULING </b><br /></p><p>The AIBA today approved a constitutional change that will now open the Olympic doors for professional boxers.</p><p>AIBA boss Ching-Kuo Wu said the change of the constitution was approved with 95 percent in favour - 84 of 88 voting members - paving the way for professionals to fight for medals for the first time at the Olympics starting on 5th August.</p><p><b>MIXED RESPONSE </b><br /></p><p>The boxing body's decision has been met with a mixed response with some like Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis calling it "foolish" and "preposterous" while others like Amir Khan welcoming the step. <span itemprop="articleBody">(<a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rio-olympics-india-mc-mary-kom-boxing/1/682422.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rio-olympics-india-mc-mary-kom-boxing/1/682422.html"><b>Rio Olympics: India to seek wildcard for MC Mary Kom</b></a>)</span></p><p>In India, AIBA's decision brought the focus on Vijender, who turned professional last year. The 30-year-old, a former amateur world No.1 in middleweight, is enjoying an unbeaten run in his pro career and is scheduled to fight for the WBO Asia title belt on 16th July in New Delhi.</p><p><b>NO TIME FOR VIJENDER</b><br /></p><p>However, the Beijing Games bronze medallist will not be seen in Rio as he is not left with any time or chance to make the cut.</p><p>"I welcome AIBA's decision of allowing professional boxers to compete in the Rio Olympics. I am yet to receive the formalities for this entire process. Since there is no federation in the country, I don't know who will guide me for this entire thing. Right now I am concentrating on my 16 July title fight to be held in New Delhi," Vijender told PTI.</p><p>Vijender's measured response to the world body's decision is not without ground given that the final Olympic qualifier for the Indians will be the AIBA World Qualifiers in Azerbaijan, starting 16th June. </p><p>The team for that event has already been finalised and since Vijender was not a part of the trials held last month, he is not in the reckoning to make the cut.</p><p>Vijender is already preparing for his next pro bout which leaves him with no time to pursue an Olympic berth at this stage.</p>]]></storybody>
