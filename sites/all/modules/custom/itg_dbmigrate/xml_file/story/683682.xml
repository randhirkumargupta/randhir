<storybody><![CDATA[<p>When you're a fiction lover, you stumble upon tales about lost cities and references to Atlantica quite often. You cannot help but wonder if there is actually a lost, forgotten land lying somewhere on a seabed, or in the pits of a volcano...</p><p>To someone that hopeful, this piece of news might be a little saddening. <b>Mysterious structures discovered under the sea near the Greek island of Zakynthos has been crossed off the list of being a possible ancient city.</b></p><p>A study published in <b>Journal of Marine and Petroleum Geology</b> on Thursday reveals that the blocks which look like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newhistorian.com/lost-city-sea-revealed-geological-formation/6596/" mce_href="http://www.newhistorian.com/lost-city-sea-revealed-geological-formation/6596/">"cobblestone paving and bases for pillars"</a>  are not human-made at all. </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p><br /></p><h3>Is it an alien-architected civilisation, then?</h3><p>Eh, no.</p><p>These structures, which may seem like ruins of ancient pillars and squares, were actually build by bacteria.</p><p>Yes, you read it right. Bacteria. </p><p>When archaeologists took a dip to inspect the site, they noticed there were <b>no signs of coins, pottery fragments and other things which confirm the existence of a human civilisation</b>. </p><p>"There's no other evidence, nothing that suggests human civilisation," Environmental scientist Julian Andrews told <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/lost-underwater-city-was-actually-made-microbes-180959299/?no-ist" mce_href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/lost-underwater-city-was-actually-made-microbes-180959299/?no-ist">Smithsonian.com</a>. "There's no pottery, no coins, nothing else that usually goes along with these things."</p><p>After analysing the mineral contents of these underwater structures, they came to the conclusion that these were built by the microorganisms. </p><p><b>Hold on, there's more.</b></p><p>{mosimage}</p><p><br /></p><h3>How did bacteria make these "structures"?</h3><p>Very simple. Bowel movement.</p><p>The archaeologists discovered that these structures contain a <b>mineral called dolomite</b>; a calcium byproduct produced by methane-consuming bacteria. </p><p>Basically, what happened - a long time ago - is the bacteria found a natural source of methane in this area under the sea. This led to the production of dolomite, a cement-like component, which settled down to form these structures.</p><p>These structures appear to be <b>about 2.6 million years old and are not unique</b>. Similar sites have been found in California's Monterey Bay, the Gulf of Cadiz in the Mediterranean, and in the North Sea. </p><p><b>Thus, what once amazed people into believing that they had found a lost city, was actually a bunch of blocks built from bacteria excreta.</b></p><p>{mosimage}</p>]]></storybody>
