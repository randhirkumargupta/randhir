<storykicker><![CDATA[Novak Djokovic became the first man to hold all four Grand Slam titles at once since Rod Laver in 1969 and Andy Murray said he was proud to take part in the historic final despite suffering defeat.<br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>In his 12th appearance at Roland Garros, and fourth final, the top-seeded Novak Djokovic earned that elusive title, casting aside a shaky opening set to dominate the rest of the way in a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 victory over No. 2 Andy Murray on Sunday. (<b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-french-open-career-grand-slam-tennis/1/683833.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-french-open-career-grand-slam-tennis/1/683833.html">Djokovic clinches maiden French Open title, completes career Grand Slam</a></b>)<br /></p><p>A dejected Murray said "it sucks to lose" the French Open final but he is proud to have played his part in Djokovic's "amazing achievement" of becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win four Grand Slam titles in a row.</p><p>"It sucks to lose the match, but I am proud to be part of today. This is something that is so rare in tennis. It's going to take a long time for it to happen again," said the Scot.</p><p>"Novak, this is his day today. What he has achieved the last 12 months is phenomenal. Winning all four in one year is amazing. This is something that is so rare in tennis. It has not happened in a long time. Everyone who was here was lucky to see it," he added.</p><p>Djokovic played down the feat when asked about it by an on-court TV interviewer, focusing instead on the love-heart he drew on the red clay dust of the Court Philippe Chatrier, as three-time champion Gustavo Kuerten famously did. The Brazilian, nicknamed "Guga," was in the crowd and smiled broadly.</p><p><b>DJOKOVIC DOES A GUGA</b></p><p>"The most important thing for me is that I wrote down that heart, like Guga did," Djokovic said. "He gave me the permission to do this. The most important is that I felt the love, and drawing a heart means I will remain on this court with you every day."</p><p>Novak Djokovic looked as though he could hardly stand after winning his first French Open title, bent over with his hands on his knees. He gathered himself, drew a heart with his racket in the clay dust, and then lay down in the middle of it, on his back.</p><p>Gustavo Kuerten, who did the same thing when he won the French Open, looked on from the crowd with a big smile on his face.</p><p>As has become his habit at this French Open he has made his own, Djokovic then celebrated with the ball girls and boys, gathering them together and then all raising their arms to the skies together.</p><p>"It's really a very special moment, perhaps the greatest moment of my career. Perhaps. Thank you," Djokovic said. "I hope you felt joy seeing our tennis."</p><p>Murray looked crushed, his eyes red, sat blankly on his chair at court side.</p>]]></storybody>
