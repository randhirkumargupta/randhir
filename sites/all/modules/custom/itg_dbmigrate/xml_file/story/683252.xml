<storybody><![CDATA[<p>It will be almost stupid of us to reiterate the fact that being a mother is one of the toughest jobs in the world. But we still will, because even today people continue to believe otherwise. </p><p>One of them being Brad Kearns, an Australian father who thought that being a mother is "the same thing" as being a father--up until he involuntarily ended up 'embracing' motherhood due to his wife, Sarah Kearns' liver failure.</p><p>Brad and Sarah are parents to 2-year-old son Knox and 6-week-old son Finn. So, when the daddy of the family had to switch places with his wife, he realised just how tough her 'job' as a mother was. </p><p><b>Also Read: <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/justin-timberlake-thinks-that-this-daughter-dad-duos-dance-is-the-cutest-thing-hes-ever-seen-cant-stop-the-feeling-trolls-anna-kendrick/1/668833.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/justin-timberlake-thinks-that-this-daughter-dad-duos-dance-is-the-cutest-thing-hes-ever-seen-cant-stop-the-feeling-trolls-anna-kendrick/1/668833.html"><u>We totally get why Justin Timberlake finds this daughter-dad dance the cutest damn thing ever</u></a><u> </u></b></p><p>Describing his Day 1 as "a ride that could only be likened to a backwards 100mph roller coaster that takes you through waterfalls of vomit, shit and lots of tears," Brad's Facebook post about the same elucidates on how he "failed" just within "16 hours of being a mum".</p><p>After a day full of taking care of his kids and staying up all night in the bargain, it wasn't long before Brad realised that he didn't have it in him to not be a mother. </p><p><b>Also Read: <u><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/watch-the-internet-is-going-crazy-over-this-babys-hilarious-reaction-to-dad-eating-asparagus-cannot-stop-laughing-baby-girl-brooklyn-inability-fail-asparagus/1/623412.html" target="_blank">The internet is going crazy over this baby's hilarious reaction to her dad eating asparagus</a> </u></b></p><p><iframe width="100%" height="657" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbraddleskearns%2Fposts%2F10154345196974101&amp;width=500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="border: currentColor; border-image: none; overflow: hidden;" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><b> </b></p><p>"I have not even mastered the ability to keep my own personal hygiene as a mum, let alone the ability to keep a house, educate children, prepare meals and even venture outside for activities," he wrote in his now-viral Facebook post. </p><p>With&nbsp;full-fledged Instagram and Facebook accounts 'DadMumLife'&nbsp;dedicated to his stint as a mother, Brad then went on to keep a journal of his daily activities. </p><p>Describing Day 2 of his 'mum life', Brad&nbsp;wrote about his hospital&nbsp;visit to Sarah (which he was evidently very relieved about).</p><p>"Earlier that day when I was talking to Sarah in hospital about the previous night and she said "I want you to write this down so you always remember just how hard it is". It is hard, It's really hard. I don't know how single parents do it. I don't understand why we as a society have these expectations of people. Maybe we don't...maybe they've just got these expectations of themselves."</p><p>While Brad's documentation of motherhood is amusing, heart-warming and downright honest, it actually gives us fodder to wonder about us appreciating our mothers enough.&nbsp;<br /></p>]]></storybody>
