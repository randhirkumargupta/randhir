<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Fearing de-population, areas close to the Line of Control (LoC) will have security implications, the Union Home Ministry has shelved a plan of providing 1,300 square ft to each household to built alternate safe shelters, away from the LoC, to be used during the cross-LoC shelling.&nbsp;</p><p>The Home Ministry has, however, approved community type bunkers saying they would be safer and in the national interest, the state home department said in response to a question in J&amp;K Assembly on Friday. The MHA has approved construction of 60 concrete community bunkers in district Jammu worth `30,000 lakh as pilot project and work has been started on them.&nbsp;</p><p><b>FRESH PROPOSAL FROM STATE GOVERNMENT&nbsp;</b></p><p>The state government has now submitted a fresh proposal of 20,125 community type bunkers for an amount of Rs 1,006.25 crore for border districts of Jammu.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the home department, following the recommendations of Parliamentary Standing Committee, the Union Home Ministry had sought a proposal for providing financial assistance for building alternative safe shelters to the residents of the border areas along the LoC in Jammu. The state Assembly also passed a resolution in the Assembly on April 9, 2015 seeking allotment of 1,300 square ft of land to the households living close to the international border (IB) and the LoC in Jammu.&nbsp;</p><p><b>SAFER OPTION&nbsp;</b></p><p>However, the MHA has argued that the construction of the community type bunkers would be safer than providing the alternative shelter at safer places to each household. The MHA has said providing land at alternative safe places would lead to the&nbsp;depopulation of the border areas, which wouldn't be in the interest of the state and the country, the Home Department response reads. In 2014, 190 incidents of cross-border firing were reported along the LoC and IB killing 14 persons including four security force personnel. The number of cross-border incidents rose to 222 killing 16 persons including nine security forces personnel.</p><p><b>MHA ALSO PLANNING TO BUILD A WALL&nbsp;</b></p><p>Apart from the community shelters, the MHA is also planning to build a wall 10 metres high and 110 km long to prevent infiltration, and protect locals from shelling across the border. The proposal for the 10-metre high fencing along the 198-km stretch of international border that separates Jammu from Pakistan was proposed by the BSF three years ago. Officials say the fencing is being erected to keep infiltrators out. They say it will be 135 feet wide and pass through 118 villages in the districts of Jammu (72), Kathua (17) and Samba (29).&nbsp;</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/3-bsf-men-killed-6-injured-in-terror-attack-on-convoy-in-kashmirs-anathnag/1/683564.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/3-bsf-men-killed-6-injured-in-terror-attack-on-convoy-in-kashmirs-anathnag/1/683564.html">Also read: </a><a target="_blank">3 BSF men killed, 6 injured in terror attack on convoy in Kashmir's Anathnag</a></b> </p>]]></storybody>
