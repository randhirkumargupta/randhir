<storybody><![CDATA[<p>It has been an endless wait for Mamta (21) and Sarita (19) who are waiting for the past 12 days to see their father Mahavir Yadav's face one last time.</p><p><b>THE ENDLESS WAIT</b></p><p>However, their father's body is still trapped amidst legal formalities and is being kept in a hospital in the Hofuf district of the eastern province of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>57-year-old Mahavir Yadav died of a heart attack in the Hofuf district of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia on May 22 this year. Since then, the girls, who are now orphans, are trying their level best to get the body back to India.</p><p>Yadav, a native of Rautpar village of Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur district, went to Saudi Arabia in 2010 to work as a painter and never returned since then. </p><p>"He used to tell us that his employer (a rich sheikh) is very cruel and besides taking work for long hours, he has also confiscated his passport," Mamta said. </p><p>Adding, "Our father was unable to come to India even when our mother died in July last year." Yadav has five daughters and three of his elder daughters are married, leaving behind only Mamta and Sarita at home. "We used to run our house with the money our father sent. We were also breeding fishes in a small pond right in front of our house but it was encroached upon by villagers soon after our mother's death", said Mamta.</p><p>Talking about the unfortunate incident, Mamta says, "Our uncle, Sardar Yadav, also worked with my father in Saudi Arabia and he has informed us that the Sheikh is not willing to hand over the passport." Talking about the delay in getting her deceased father's body back, Mamta says, "My uncle told us that the Sheikh is saying he will hand over the passport only after the legal formalities are completed. "Some of our neighbours told us that we need to send a notary document to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to get back the body of our father. Accordingly, we sent it to the MEA but are yet to receive a response", said Mamta. "We would like to request Sushma Swaraj ji to help us out as we have heard that she is a very active and responsible minister," she added.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dalit-famly-bares-it-all-after-greater-noida-police-fails-to-register-their-fir/1/495155.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dalit-famly-bares-it-all-after-greater-noida-police-fails-to-register-their-fir/1/495155.html">Also read: Dalit family bares it all after Greater Noida police fails to register their FIR</a></b> </p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
