<storykicker><![CDATA[A section in the BJP feels that though the intent may be all right, the overt projection of this new-found love for Dalits may boomerang badly on the party in the election.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Rahul Gandhi learnt it the hard way and by all indicators BJP president Amit Shah will learn it the harder way. Simply because he has much more to lose. Rahul Gandhi's famous Dalit sojourns in Uttar Pradesh from 2009 to 2012, in the build-up to UP elections and the subsequent results, made him an object of ridicule.&nbsp; <br /></p><p><b>BJP WOOS DALITS </b><br /></p><p>Enter 2016. Two back-to-back tailor-made events showcasing BJP party president Amit Shah hobnobbing with the Dalit community had several BJP leaders in UP wondering if they were also headed the Congress way.</p><p>Ever since Narendra Modi government had come to power, there seems to be a concerted effort to appropriate Dalits and their icons, the most famous being Dr BR Ambedkar. Last year, Modi government announced that Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated as "Samajik Samrasta Diwas". On that particular day PM Modi was at Ambedkar's birth place in Mhow (officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar). As a long-term strategy, BJP seemed to be cruising smoothly.</p><p>But barely a year away from the all-important UP elections, BJP President Amit Shah has upped the ante in his pursuit of the elusive Dalit vote. During Sihansth Kumbh, Shah took a holy dip along with Dalit seers at the Valrico Ghat of Kshipra River and later on had food with them. The programme was named Samrasta Snan (Social harmony bath). As the event and its significance picked up pace in the media, BJP leaders tried their level best to downplay the event, claiming it wasn't political. But the intent was not lost on anybody.</p><p>On May 31, BJP president Amit Shah was on his way to Allahabad from Varanasi to hold a rally and on the way stopped at a Dalit house in Jogiyarpur village of Varanasi to have lunch. The photographs which came out of that lunch were strikingly similar to Rahul Gandhi's from the run-up to the 2012 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.</p><p><b>CASTE MATRIX</b><br /></p><p>The ruling SP and the BSP were quick to criticise this. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav called it "drama" and BSP leader Mayawati termed it a "nautanki" (drama), saying that BJP can never be a well-wisher of Dalits.</p><p>A section in the BJP feels that though the intent may be all right, the overt projection of this new-found love for Dalits may boomerang badly on the party in the election. According to a Uttar Pradesh BJP leader, "If the party is thinking that like 2014, a major chunk of Mayawati vote bank will go to BJP, then they are sadly mistaken. The year 2014 was Modi wave. But 2017 is a completely different election and we will have to acknowledge the changed ground reality".</p><p>Though, the BJP leaders were quick to downplay this by saying that this was just an impromptu stopover at one of party's workers place and wasn't planned, the explanation didn't cut much ice. There are several people within the Uttar Pradesh BJP who feel that if the Opposition is able to get this impression across then instead of getting Dalit votes, they might end up upsetting its upper caste and non-Yadavs OBC's. The Uttar Pradesh unit also feels that with aggressive wooing of Brahmins and upper caste voters by both BSP, Congress and SP, this overture of the BJP can very easily upset the caste calculus in Uttar Pradesh and then they will be neither here nor there. Majority of leaders in the state believes that that Dalits are a mainstay of Mayawati's vote bank and will not get swayed over these symbolic gestures and the party will have to adopt a longer narrative to win them over.</p><p>A UP BJP leader summed it up perfectly, "If we don't play to our strengths in Uttar Pradesh and keep on chasing mirages, then our situation could very well be like - Na Khuda mila, na visaley sanam".</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amit-shah-dines-with-dalits-to-carry-forward-bjps-agenda/1/682163.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amit-shah-dines-with-dalits-to-carry-forward-bjps-agenda/1/682163.html">Amit Shah dines with Dalits, Mayawati calls it melodrama</a> &nbsp; </b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
