move seeking the renaming of Akbar Road or any other suitable road in 
the Lutyens' Zone as Maharana Pratap Road. <br /><br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Gen (Retd)VK Singh, minister of state for external affairs, launched a full-fledged attack on those who criticised his proposal to have Akbar Road renamed as Maharana Pratap Road, saying, "If you talk of the Hindus, vested interests in this country will brand you anti-other religions (sic)." Singh took to Facebook to say India had never been defeated in war till 'insiders' sold out national interests to foreign powers. Giving examples of Jaichand, Shakti Singh, Mir Jafar and others, the former Chief of Army Staff talked of today's self-styled intellectuals whose criticism of his initiative hurt him.</p><p><b>SLAMMING THE CRITICS</b><br /></p><p>Gen Singh wrote that he was shocked with the way people reacted to his move seeking the renaming of Akbar Road or any other suitable road in the Lutyens' Zone as Maharana Pratap Road. "Maharana Pratap united 36 different communities and fought a powerful foreign force for freedom of his land. Imagine a conflict where his own brother (Shakti Singh) was leading the enemy army. But the man being hailed as Great (Akbar) killed 25,000 people including women, children and the old in Mewar (sic),'' the General wrote in his Facebook post.</p><p>"My point is if we give so much importance to the Mughals, then going by the same logic we should also build memorials after Robert Clive and Lord Dalhousie who ruled India in the same manner as the Mughals,'' he added. The General insisted that the nation now has to decide who it needs to be proud of - those who subjugated the people of India or those who fought for their independence.</p><p>The BJP refused to comment on the General's Facebook post saying it is his personal opinion, but the Congress hit out saying it reflected the BJP's mindset.</p><p>"BJP as a whole, Gen VK Singh included has been practising the politics of so called historical revenge especially targeted against a particular religion and community. He should learn from Maharana Pratap himself who would fight Akbar honourably but never belittle or trivialise the historic achievements of Akbar,'' says Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Congress MP and spokesperson.</p><p>"Both Maharana Pratap and Akbar were giants and today's pygmies can understand neither," he added. <br /><b><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vk-singh-calls-attack-on-africans-a-minor-scuffle-blown-up-by-media/1/680681.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vk-singh-calls-attack-on-africans-a-minor-scuffle-blown-up-by-media/1/680681.html">Also read: VK Singh calls attack on Africans 'a minor scuffle blown up by media'</a></b> </p>]]></storybody>
