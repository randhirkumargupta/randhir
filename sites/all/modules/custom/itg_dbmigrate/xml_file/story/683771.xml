<storykicker><![CDATA["Freedom of speech should also include the right to insult."]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p><b>Are comedians required to be bound by the sensitivities and emotions of the public while preparing a script? where/how do you draw the limit?<br /></b>I can speak only for myself. Drawing the limit is a function of my own moral code, IQ, fears, and sensitivity. Moral code tells me to avoid punching down (so no jokes on suppressed minorities), IQ tells me a joke has to be intelligent enough to have any existence, fears are from the censorship and the religious right wing (Hindu and Muslim both) as well as establishment of the day so I choose my battles, and sensitivity is about knowing the cultural/social context of the audience I am performing for. I am not saying I don't breach some or all of the above criteria from time to time but&nbsp;I do that knowingly whenever&nbsp;I do.</p><p><b>Is there a fine line between insult and comedy? should freedom of expression also include the right to offend?<br /></b>Freedom of expression, in my opinion, should totally include the right to insult. Not even in comedy but in public/political sphere too. As long as there is no direct call to violence, all verbal/written/artistic expression should be free from such categorisation.<br /><br /><b>Also Read:<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/varun-grover-tickles-funny-bones-at-india-today-conclave-2016/1/626380.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/varun-grover-tickles-funny-bones-at-india-today-conclave-2016/1/626380.html"> <u>Varun Grover tickles funny bones at India Today Conclave 2016</u></a><u> <br /></u></b><br /><b>Has writing comedy got tougher in the past two years? are there more limitations, threats?<br /></b>Yes. Somehow the most humourless, self-serious, and feeling-proud bunch has become the most vocal group on social media as well as in newsrooms. And when people have too much pride, they are like a tightly filled balloon. Even an innocuous joke can burst them. But as I keep saying, the worst times for comedy are the best times. Comedy feeds on desperate times in a society.</p><p><b>Is controversy the new cool in comedy? is there an attempt to become famous by piggy-riding on the popularity of national icons?</b> <br />Controversy has been the cool in politics, films, art world, journalism everywhere. Comedians don't create them (yet) those crazy for TRP such as news media and those crazy to please their leaders (read small time politicos) create them. If becoming famous was so easy, then the world would have been full of famous people only. In fact the people pretending to be hurt are piggy-riding. And they will never be famous.<br /><br /><b>Also Read:<a href="http://m.indiatoday.in/conclave2016/video.jsp?id=4421" target="_blank" mce_href="http://m.indiatoday.in/conclave2016/video.jsp?id=4421"> <u>I feel we can't do comedy these days: Varun Grover</u></a><u> <br /></u></b><br /><b>How difficult is writing a good comic script (making people laugh)? what is the process involved? how long does it take? is there a lack of good original ideas?<br /></b>How difficult? Depends on person to person. And joke to joke. Process again is too individualistic and internal to be described in text. But most of the times, anything that makes you go WHAT THE F*** at first sight has a joke in it.</p>]]></storybody>
