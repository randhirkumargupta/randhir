<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A Delhi court has questioned the decision of not granting prosecution sanction against a senior bureaucrat in a case related to the Commonwealth Games scam. </p><p>While two junior NDMC officials were charged for alleged corruption as there was no delay in the mandatory prosecution sanction by the competent authority, the court expressed its disappointment on why then NDMC chairman, Parimal Rai was let off despite the CBI furnishing evidence against him.</p><p><b>WHAT IS THE CASE?</b> <br /></p><p>The case relates to the alleged irregularities in award the tender to an international company - M/s China Railway Shisiju Group Corporation - to upgrade the Shivaji Stadium ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Special CBI Judge AK Jain observed that the sanction was refused without disclosing any reasons for the same. He directed the Centre to submit reasons for refusal within three months and said the sanction would be set aside in case of non-compliance of the order.</p><p>The court observed that while sanction to prosecute RS Thakur was granted within six months, the Centre took years to refuse sanction of Rai. "In the present case, it appears that higher public servants are shielded and lower-level officers are offered as bait. </p><p><b>EVIDENCE</b><br /></p><p>As per the material on record, irregularities were found both at the stage of technical evaluation as well as the financial evaluation in awarding the contract worth Rs 160 crore to a foreign company, which was in the knowledge of Parimal Rai. However, he did not take any action. Various objections were raised by the finance department which were avoided," the order said.</p><p>However, the court mentioned that the Centre need not be influenced by this order and act independently over the relevant matter. Special CBI Judge, AK Jain took cognizance of the chargesheet field under section 120-B r/w, 420 IPC, 13(2) r/w, 13(1) and Prevention of Corruption Act and summoned two Vinay Kumar Gulati, NDMC executive engineer, superintendent engineer, Randhir Singh Thakur, China Railway Shisiju Group Corporation and its subletee company Simplex Project Limited along with other five individuals representing the companies and asked them to appear before it on September 14.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/discus-thrower-seema-punia-clinches-rio-olympics-berth/1/680088.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/discus-thrower-seema-punia-clinches-rio-olympics-berth/1/680088.html">Also read: Discus thrower Seema Punia clinches Rio Olympics berth</a> </b></p>]]></storybody>
