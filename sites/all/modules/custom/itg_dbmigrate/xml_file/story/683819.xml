<storykicker><![CDATA[In Lalit Modi's case, ED lost all its hope from Interpol when it received another official 
query, seventh time in a row, seeking some answers of repeated 
questions.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has clarified on the information floating in the public domain that Interpol has denied issuing a Red Corner Notice (RCN) against liquor baron Vijay Mallya. The ED has categorically said that "till now - it has received only one official query from Interpol on Vijay Mallya case, seeking some case details - but no denial yet." </p><p>The agency has confirmed to IndiaToday.in that it has received a formal communication from Interpol after "reviewing" the RCN proposal against Mallya. </p><p>"Few days back, we received a formal email from Interpol - which includes a set of questionnaires, seeking case details of Mallya and reasons for issuing a Red Corner Notice against him. But as being speculated, there is no denial from Interpol that RCN would not be issued against Mallya," the source said. The ED is supposed to reply to Interpol's queries within a week.</p><p><b>INTERPOL QUESTIONS ED FOR 7th TIME </b></p><p>But in Lalit Modi's case, the ED lost all its hope from Interpol when it received another official query, seventh time in a row, seeking some answers of repeated questions. Sources confirmed IndiaToday.in that almost 20 days back - the agency received the seventh query from Interpol via email in Lalit Modi case, to which the reply has been sent by the agency last week itself.</p><p>The ED had first approached Interpol in August 2015 for notifying RCN against Modi, but it kept delaying acting on the request with a string of queries from Indian agency, with the latest being seeking status of "judicial decision" and "predicate offence" against Modi.</p><p>"It was the seventh query from Interpol to us, asking some repeated questions. This time, we were asked whether the agency has "judicial decision" against Modi. In reply, we denied and said "we do not have judicial decision" against Modi," the source said to IndiaToday.in. Not having judicial decision means chances of getting RCN issued against Modi is now almost over.</p><p>Interpol has also asked the agency, the status of the predicate offence registered against Modi by the Chennai Police. The ED had registered a money laundering case against Modi and others based on the complaint by Chennai Police in 2012. </p><p><b>NO CHARGESHEET BY CHENNAI POLICE AGAINST MODI SINCE 2012</b></p><p>Chennai Police though has not filed a chargesheet against Modi since 2012, for unknown reasons, which is giving sleepless nights to ED and a protective cover to Modi. Hence, the ED headquarters had also written to the Tamil Nadu Police to expedite action in the FIR.</p><p>Earlier, IndiaToday.in was the first to expose how ex-officials of Interpol have been hired by Modi in London to strategise his legal battle against Indian agencies and Interpol. As per the plan, Lalit Modi has been defined as, political character or political victim of the Indian government before Interpol - ensuring that the global body does not issue a Red Corner Notice against him in haste.</p><p>One of the communications shared between two ex-Interpol officials said, "any case that might be brought by India against Modi would be considered to be of a predominantly political character and thus would be in violation of Article 3 of Interpol's Constitution." In case Interpol plans to issue a RCN against Modi then, "it could threaten a multi-billion dollar transaction", the communication continued.</p><p>Few months back, with no help coming on this front from Interpol, ED got court's nod to begin extradition proceedings against Modi, whom it suspects to be based in the UK. The extradition request was granted by a special PMLA court in Mumbai. The same court had earlier issued a non-bailable warrant against Modi in the same case on the basis of which the ED wanted an Interpol RNC issued last year.</p><p><b>WHAT ED WANTS</b></p><p>The ED wants Modi to join investigation in a case relating to T-20 Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament after it registered an FIR against him and others in 2012.</p><p>The agency also fears that Lalit Modi and his legal team with deep network in Interpol might be extending support to Mallya as well - who is residing in London, now. "Not only legal help to fight Indian agencies and to argue in Interpol's Commission, but like LaMo, Mallya too would define himself as a political victim/character of Indian government and stay away from the clutches of agencies,' the ED source said.</p>]]></storybody>
