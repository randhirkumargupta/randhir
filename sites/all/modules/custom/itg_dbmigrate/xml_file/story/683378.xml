<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Residents of Gurugram, considered a symbol of newly affluent India, are plumbing the depths of despair with the water table in the city plunging to new lows. The district's hydrology department says the groundwater level has reached a "dark zone", which, according to officials, is 20 metres below the surface in north India. No further extraction is allowed after this.</p><p>Authorities say the water table had sunk to 34.84 metres in some areas till October 2015. Experts say the plight of Gurugram, where apartment complexes and corporate high rises are sprouting like concrete weeds, reflects the larger problem of designing cities without people in mind. Mail Today has access to government data that say in 1974 the groundwater level of Gurugram was 6.64 metres but it had reached an average of 27.05 metres by October last year.<br /><b><br />DEPLETION</b></p><p>Faridabad, another town in Haryana with a water table identical to Gurugram's in 1974, touched 17.55 metres in October 2015. The state's Mahendragarh district has registered the highest depletion, with the water table plummeting to 45.18 metres. "We have collected samples from 62 pits across the district and it has been observed that there's a steady decline in the city groundwater table, up to 1.5 to 2 metres on an average every year. The frequent depletion in urban areas is more than that in rural areas," said BS Lamba, Gurugram's chief hydrologist. According to analysts, the big reasons for the groundwater exhaustion in urban areas are commercial high rises and residential apartments. They have their own extraction units inside the premises to draw water at a large scale to meet their needs.<br /><b><br />POLICIES</b></p><p>"Millennium City Gurugram has no monitoring policies to keep tabs on residential societies and upscale condominiums," said RS Rathi, president of the residents' welfare association in Qutab Enclave DLF Phase 1. "Moreover, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), responsible for supplying water to the city, only reaches authorised localities, while a large number of illegal colonies have come up over the years, and these depend on tube wells and bore wells to extract groundwater." The groundwater table has sunk to about 45 to 50 metres in parts of DLF City, Sohna Road and Sector 56 due to a high concentration of residential complexes. The situation could get worse as dozens of upscale condominiums are coming up in nearby areas like Golf Course Extension Road, Dwarka Expressway and Pataudi Road. </p><p>Experts say the development boom in the city took local authorities by surprise and they did not plan adequately for the power and water needs of the burgeoning population. Being a business hub, the factories here also have a significant role in the extraction of groundwater and contamination through industrial waste. According to Haryana government's industrial policy, each manufacturing unit must install a chemical treatment plant (CTP) inside the premises. Gurugram has 8 to 10 large scale chemical and dye units in Behrampur, but none of them has set up CTPs. Automobile companies too generate chemical waste at a massive scale. "The installation of CTPs inside the units is mandatory as per the policies of the Haryana government. Since no one has installed CTPs in their facilities, the Haryana state pollution control board is going to write letters to them," said Bhupindar Singh, regional officer, Gurugram north zone.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gurugram-reels-under-blackout-as-thunderstorm-disrupts-normal-life/1/681335.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gurugram-reels-under-blackout-as-thunderstorm-disrupts-normal-life/1/681335.html">Also read: 1 dead, normal life disrupted after heavy rain and thunderstorm hit Gurugram </a> <br /></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
