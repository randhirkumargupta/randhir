<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing lawyers' verification process, which was ordered by the Supreme Court to weed out fake advocates from legal system, has thrown up some shocking details. </p><p>According to the Bar Council of India (BCI), Delhi may have maximum number of fake lawyers practicing in various courts. </p><p><b>DELHI - DEN OF FAKE LAWYERS?</b></p><p>BCI's own data reveal that there are 55,000 registered lawyers in Delhi at present. Out of these, more than 20,000 are those who have valid licence but they aren't actively practising. </p><p>BCI chairman Manan K Mishra told India Today that lawyers in Delhi are against the verification process because a large number of them have fake certificates. </p><p>RK Wadhwa, former chief of coordination committee of Delhi district courts, described Supreme Court's order regarding verification as a step in the right direction. </p><p>"This is a right step. This would help concerned authorities in weeding out lawyers who have nothing do with the legal system, courts of the country. I believe there at least 20,000 such lawyers in Delhi itself," Wadhwa said.</p><p><b>NOOSE TIGHTENS ON FAKE LAWYERS</b></p><p>Following the Supreme Court's directive, the BCI has asked its state units to authenticate the degrees of all registered lawyers. Lawyers would be given a 'practicing lawyer' certificate. According to new guidelines, lawyers having this certificate would only be allowed to practice in courts. </p><p>"There are about 20 lakh lawyers in the country. The council, since its establishment in 1961, had never carried out any such verification process for lawyers. We never had any data concerning lawyers in the country. We will have it now. The process will help to eliminate fake lawyers," BCI chief Mishra said.</p><p><b>THE VERIFICATION PROCESS</b></p><p>Implementation of BCI Certificate and Place of Practice (Verification) Rules 2015 means it is mandatory for all lawyers to re-register in a new format where they have to submit all their certificates starting Class X board results. </p><p>These certificates will then be verified with respective universities and boards.</p>]]></storybody>
