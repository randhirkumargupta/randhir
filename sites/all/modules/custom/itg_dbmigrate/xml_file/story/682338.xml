<storykicker><![CDATA[Sanjeeda Sheikh who's playing the role of mother for the first time in Ishq Ka Rang Safed has come a long way from Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka. Here are 5 of her best roles.<br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Sanjeeda Sheikh who has just been roped in place of Eisha Singh on Colors show Ishq Ka Rang Safed has come a long way from playing an awkward teenager in Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka to playing a strong and confident mother in this Colors soap. After spending almost a decade in television industry, Sanjeeda is confident of pulling off this role on the show after the 5-year leap. While Dhani was shy and non-opinionated before the leap, Sanjeeda will make the character bolder and stronger.</p><p>"It all depends on the way you look when you play a mother. Now, actresses like Kareena (Kapoor Khan) and Jacqueline (Fernandez) play mother onscreen and nobody questions them. Earlier, I had a fear to play a mother but at this stage of my career I am pretty much confident," Sanjeeda told PTI.</p><p>As the actress embarks on a new journey with the show, we look at her five most memorable roles in the past.</p><p><b>1. Nimmo in Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka:</b> Do you remember this 2006 soap--which was also Sanjeeda's debut as a leading actress--where cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu played 'God' and helped Nimmo aka Sanjeeda to battle with her bad luck? As the storyline of Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka went, Nimmo a middle-class girl always found herself in situations where she ran out of luck. But thankfully enough 'God' always came to her rescue and helped her come of the tricky situation. Sanjeeda was cast opposite Eijaz Khan in the soap. Jennifer Winget and Sanjit Bedi were also part of the show.{mosimage}</p><p><b>2. Ayesha in Kayamath:</b> Though she wasn't the main protagonist in Kayamath, her image went for a major overhaul when she played the wicked Ayesha in the soap. Initially, her role had positive shades, but that soon turned into negative, when she came to know about her past and decided to embark on a revenge past. Interestingly, Ayesha continued to take her revenge ever after her death as a ghost.&nbsp; Apart from her, the soap starred Kumkum Bhagya star Shabir Ahuluwalia and Panchi Bora as the main protagonists.{mosimage}</p><p><b>3. Naina in Kya Dill Mein Hai:</b> Kya Dill Mein Hai also starred her current partner Aamir Ali, but she again did not play the main lead in this. But her entry results in a major twist on the show.&nbsp; An 18-year-old girl, Kakun (Abigail Jain), goes against her parents wishes to marry the man of her dreams, Anurag (Aamir Ali). What happens when Anurag falls in love with Naina (played by Sanjeeda Sheikh)?{mosimage}</p><p><b>4. Radhika in Jaane Pehchaane Se... Ye Ajnabbi:</b> Sanjeeda has even worked with former Balika Vadhu star and current host of India's Got Talent Sidharth Shukla in Jaane Pehchaane Se... Ye Ajnabbi. Sanjeeda enters the show after the lead character (Aditi Tailang) ungoes a plastic surgery. We are still not able to forget its melodious title track.{mosimage}</p><p><b>5. Sejal in Hi! Padosi... Kaun Hai Doshi?</b>: Anyone who has seen Sanjeeda in Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka must agree that she has an awesome comic timing. In Hi! Padosi... Kaun Hai Doshi? Sanjeeda worked with none other than comedy legend Kader Khan. It also starred Giriraj Kabra as Bittu.{mosimage}</p>]]></storybody>
