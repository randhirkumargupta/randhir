<storykicker><![CDATA[SRFTI Chairman writes to victim assuring full support after she wrote to I&amp;B ministry complaining against him for being 'insensitive']]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A day after India Today revealed how a female student was facing the worst kind of victim shaming and intimidation at one of country's premiere film schools in Kolkata, the Satyajit Ray Film &amp; Television Institute (SRFTI), college administration finally reached out to her on Thursday.<br />&nbsp;<br />After much delay, the institute handed over the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) report to the rape victim while its chairman personally promised full support.</p><p>Responding to the victim's allegations SRFTI Chairman Partha Ghose wrote, "Let me assure you that I have all sympathy and support for you." He also said that the final year student had misunderstood him.<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>OPEN LETTER AGAINST AUTHORITIES</b></p><p>The victim had earlier shot a letter to the Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting, accusing Chairman Partha Ghose of being insensitive.<br />&nbsp;<br />In her open letter, she wrote, <i>"I am writing this letter to report the harassment that I had to face from the chairperson of the institute, Mr Partha Ghose.</i></p><p><i>After the ICC had found two professors guilty of sexual harassment, the violence from the students to me, other complainants and our supporters have shot up.<br />&nbsp;<br />I am writing this to bring to your notice how a girl who spoke up against sexual harassment is constantly being harassed by students, faculty and the highest of authorities.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Internal Complaints Committee, set up in accordance with the Vishakha Guidelines, had submitted its report in April. The report has indicted two faculty members and seeks strict action against them. However, it had not been shared with the complainants though a copy was provided to the accused.<br />&nbsp;<br />Complainants, who had charged three professors with sexual harassment, have been crying foul over the SRFTI administration's reluctance to share the report with them."</i><br />&nbsp;<br /><b>PROFESSOR VS STUDENTS</b></p><p>Narrating her ordeal to India Today TV on Tuesday, the final year film student had explained how she was facing an extremely hostile environment at the institute.<br />&nbsp;<br />Claiming that she was being openly threatened and intimidated by a section of students in connivance with the accused faculty members, the victim sought immediate action against those professors who have been indicted in the ICC probe report.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the meantime, SRFTI Director Debanjan Chakraborty, who had taken over the position on an ad-hoc basis resigned from his post. Speaking to India Today Chakraborty said, he wanted to close the matter promptly but hinted at the possibility of a resistance against the complainants.<br />&nbsp;<br />Claiming that there were several stakeholders, Chakraborty lamented how fissures had appeared within the students community with those that supported the cause of the victims while others who support the accused professors.&nbsp; </p><p>"I can only hope that the issue is resolved before the two belligerent sides reach a point of no return," he added.<br /></p>]]></storybody>
