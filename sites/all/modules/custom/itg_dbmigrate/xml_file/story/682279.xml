<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan paceman Mohammad Amir, who spent time in jail and served a five-year ban for spot-fixing, will be able to handle the pressure of returning to England if he is granted a visa for their upcoming tour, said team-mate Azhar Ali. (<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/category/cricket/1/125.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/category/cricket/1/125.html"><b>Latest Cricket stories</b></a>)<br /></p><p>Amir was considered one of the most exciting fast bowlers in the world before a 2010 spot-fixing scandal that resulted in bans and jail sentences for him, former Test captain Salman Butt and fast bowler Mohammad Asif. (<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/javed-miandad-pakistan-cricket-board-slams-training-camps-inzamam-ul-haq/1/682129.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/javed-miandad-pakistan-cricket-board-slams-training-camps-inzamam-ul-haq/1/682129.html"><b>Miandad slams PCB for exhausting players with hectic training schedule</b></a>) </p><p>The trio were cleared to return to the sport by the International Cricket Council (ICC) last September after serving suspensions.</p><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board has requested a visa for Amir, who has already toured New Zealand for a limited over series, played in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh and featured in the World Twenty20 in India since serving his ban.</p><p>Azhar had offered his resignation as one-day captain when Amir was brought back into the Pakistan fold but is now keen to move on and says the team will support the 24-year-old quick if he needs it in England.</p><p><b>THING OF THE PAST</b></p><p>"(What happened in) 2010 is in the past and now we need to look forward," Azhar told reporters on Tuesday.</p><p>"It has been a while now since he has been with us. It could have been tough, had he come in straight on such a tour, but now, after playing with us for a long time, things have settled.</p><p>"Even he isn't under pressure because he has already made his comeback a few months ago and the toughest phase is over for him," Azhar said.</p><p>"I know England was the place where the incident happened but hopefully he can handle the pressure like he did on his comeback. But still if anything happens, we, as a team, will handle it."</p><p>Pakistan will play four Tests, five one-dayers and a Twenty20 International in England between July 14 and September 7.</p>]]></storybody>
