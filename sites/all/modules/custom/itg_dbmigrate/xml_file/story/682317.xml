<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The way dancing one's way to a new language has to be the most unique way of learning, but for Shalu Chopra, director at Mundo Latino, this was how she not just learnt Spanish, but also started her own Latin American language school in Kotla, New Delhi. "My husband and I were travelling in Miami many years ago, and we once saw hoards of people dancing and changing partners. Though we considered ourselves to be good dancers, we had no idea what these wonderful folk were doing. It was salsa," she shares. </p><p>Returning to India, they decided to learn the dance, but Chopra wanted to really get into the feel of it by understanding the essence of the songs in Spanish. "That was when we went to learn Spanish together. Though my husband gave up after 15 days, I continued because I found the Hispanic world very mesmerising. To keep my language alive, I was advised to teach but it never interested me because it was such a fixed method with no room for my creativity," shares Chopra, who had previously been working as an interior decorator with a degree in fashion. </p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/meet-geeta-who-went-from-being-a-marital-rape-victim-to-a-bollywood-stuntwoman/1/682274.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/meet-geeta-who-went-from-being-a-marital-rape-victim-to-a-bollywood-stuntwoman/1/682274.html"><u><b>Also read:

It was appreciated and students liked the classes." </p><p>With the encouragement of her husband, a CEO with a French company and entrepreneur, she launched her own academy in 2008 and developed her own methodologies for easier communication. "I've created something called 'SWIRRL', which is speaking, writing, interaction, reading, role play and listening. We decode the language pictorially for our students, and I've developed a formulae named 'el balance' which is the agreement of the feminine and masculine elements in Spanish language," she shares. </p><p>Chopra has also recently launched a language book Viva Latino Espanol 1 making her the first Indian to write a Spanish methodology book. The 'Make In India' initiative also keeps in mind the Skill India aspect, as she explains, "We get a lot of people from Rajasthan and Agra, some who have never been to a school. They want to be guides and we teach them Spanish. Some of them are doing very well now--they earn and travel as interpreters around India, living a different life all together." </p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/trybeatingmelightly-project-fierce-empowered-professionals-modern-day-pakistani-women-social-media-beat-council-of-islamic-ideology/1/681775.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/trybeatingmelightly-project-fierce-empowered-professionals-modern-day-pakistani-women-social-media-beat-council-of-islamic-ideology/1/681775.html"><u><b>Also read:

So far we have had dancers from 35 countries along with Indians," she states. </p><p>Apart from her personal enthusiasm, Chopra gives immense credit to her supportive husband and family for reaching this far. "We have a love marriage, and no secrets we met at a dance party," she laughs, adding, "He is a friend, a mentor, a husband, everything." Speaking of her success mantra, she states, "I have always followed my passion. I feel if you do what you love, things unfold on their own and the path gets easier. The enthusiasm and passion, energy made my journey very beautiful."</p><p>As for the increasing stresses in the work environment, she advises, "I feel a bit of stress is very important to be successful. You need to be a bit nervous to excel. What you need to take care of is that thin line of getting into depression or negative energy. Its' the way you take it--if you take it in a positive way, you get positive results."</p>]]></storybody>
