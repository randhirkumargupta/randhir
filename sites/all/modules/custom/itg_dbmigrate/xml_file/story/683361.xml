<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Even as the Bihar School Examination Board put on hold the results of the Intermediate toppers of Arts and Science stream and ordered re-examination, toppers Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shrestha are unsure of appearing for the re-examination.</p><p>India Today expose, few days back had shown how Arts topper Ruby Rai and Science topper Saurabh Shreshtha were completely clueless about their respective subjects which they had topped raising doubts over the manner in which they secured the top position. The expose had raised questions over the prevailing education system in the state and how the mafia involved in education were indulging into this business of promising top ranks to candidates in exchange for money.</p><p>Both, Ruby and Saurabh, coincidentally are students of Bishun Rai College in Hajipur which has over the last few years attained the status of producing toppers year after year through dubious manner.</p><p><b>SAURABH'S FATHER BLAMES MEDIA </b><br /></p><p>A day before both these two toppers along with other four toppers of their respective stream appear for the re-examination, India Today visited the house of Saurabh Shreshth on Thursday. Saurabh's father Ajay Singh blamed the media for the unnecessary exposure they have got in last few days for all the wrong reason. On being questioned whether his son would be appearing for the intermediate re-examination for toppers on Friday, he sounded non committal. He said that his son was in Kota, Rajasthan preparing for medical entrance exams.</p><p>Ajay Singh said, "The Board should have given some more time for the re-examination so that my son could have come back".</p><iframe src="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/embed/is7rx4pppc" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="396" width="648"></iframe>

<p>Singh also denied reports of his son using a dummy candidate to clear intermediate exams. </p><p>"My son himself appeared for the exams. There is no question of him using a fake candidate to pass exams," said Saurabh's father.</p><p>Ajay Singh also cried political conspiracy to malign his family's as his wife was contesting for "mukhia" in the ongoing panchayat polls in the state.</p><p><b>RUBY'S GRANDFATHER DISMISSES REPORTS</b><br /></p><p>Similarly, when India Today visited Ruby Rai's house, she along with her parents were not available.</p><p>Ruby's grandfather said that the family had gone to Tata Nagar to attend a family marriage and therefore whether Ruby would appear for re-exams was not sure. The grandfather also dismissed reports of any malpractice by Ruby or her parents to pass intermediate exams. Interestingly, the owner of the notorious Bishun Rai College, Baccha Rai met Ruby's family on Thursday morning.</p><p>The Bihar government which last year had received flaks from all section of the society when pictures of massive cheating in matric exams made headlines had made enormous arrangement this time around to conduct free and fair examination but all the efforts have gone in vain as the image of the state once again has been tarnished.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-board-topper-political-science-review-exam/1/682423.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-board-topper-political-science-review-exam/1/682423.html">Bihar Board topper says pol science is about cooking, will undergo review exam</a></b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
