<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Amid the Centre's outreach to assure African nationals of their safety following&nbsp;a spate of attacks on them in Delhi and other parts of the country, the Goa CM has issued a statement which is likely to trigger a fresh debate.</p><p>Goa CM Minister Laxmikant Parsekar said that people of his state are "annoyed" with the behaviour, attitude and way of life of Nigerians living in the coastal region.</p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/africans-attacked-in-india-sushma-swaraj-racial-discrimination/1/681657.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/africans-attacked-in-india-sushma-swaraj-racial-discrimination/1/681657.html"><u><font color="#0066cc"><b>Lynching of Congolese man not a racial attack, says Sushma Swaraj</b></font></u></a><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p><p><b>PARSEKAR'S CONTROVERSIAL QUOTE</b></p><p>"The Goans in general are complaining about these foreigners. We get people from all other countries, but in general the people of Goa are very much annoyed with their (Nigerians') behaviour, with their attitude, with their way of life," Parsekar said. </p><p>"I cannot generalise. But generally people in Goa are not happy with these people," Parsekar said.</p><p>The CM's remark was in connection with a case in which a Nigerian allegedly raped a 31-year-old woman in Assagao village, 20 km from Panaji.</p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vk-singh-calls-attack-on-africans-a-minor-scuffle-blown-up-by-media/1/680681.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vk-singh-calls-attack-on-africans-a-minor-scuffle-blown-up-by-media/1/680681.html"><u><font color="#0066cc"><b>VK Singh calls attack on Africans 'a minor scuffle blown up by media'</b></font></u></a><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p><p><b>DEPORT NIGERIANS: TOURISM MINISTER</b> </p><p>Goa's Tourism Minister Dilip Parulekar had earlier demanded a new law to facilitate quick deportation of Nigerians. </p><p>"Nigerians create problem not just in Goa, but in the entire country. Nigerian students come to Goa, India to study, they get an FIR filed (against them), make it a judicial matter and they try to stay in India or Goa and indulge in drugs and other unwanted things," Parulekar had said on Monday. </p><p>The minister's comments came at a time his party's government at the Centre has launched damage control after attacks on Africans, including the lynching of a Congolese national on May 20 in Delhi. Six African students have alleged that they were attacked in Delhi last week and a Nigerian student was also allegedly assaulted over a parking dispute in Hyderabad.</p><p><b>TROUBLEMONGERS?</b></p><p>In October 2013, over 50 Nigerians had blocked the National Highway 17 in Goa, to protest against police inaction following a murder of a Nigerian national, allegedly by a local drug cartel. </p><p>The blockade had also seen police and locals being beaten up by the protesting Nigerians, before some of the foreigners were also beaten up in retaliation by a local mob. </p><p><b><i>(With IANS inputs)</i></b>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read:</b><br /></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/attack-on-africans-delhi-racism-media-hype/1/681136.html " target="_blank">Attack on Africans: Racism or media hype?</a> </b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ola-cab-driver-beaten-african-nationals-delhi/1/680585.html " target="_blank">Delhi: Ola cabbie thrashed by African nationals for refusing to carry extra passengers</a> </b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
