<storykicker><![CDATA[The Mathura Police has launched a massive manhunt for Ramvriksh Yadav, who is believed to be the mastermind of yesterday's violence. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A lesser known 'Netaji cult' group called Azad Bharat Vidhik Vaicharik Kranti Satyagrahi fired upon police when a huge continent of forces reached Jawahar Bagh area of Mathura resulting in death of 2 cops, including the SP City and an SHO and injuring many. Total 24 people were killed in the unprecedented violence the temple town witnessed yesterday.</p><p><b>PROTESTERS WERE WELL PREPARED, ARMED</b></p><p>When police resorted to retaliatory firing it killed as much as 22 activists who have been illegally occupying hundreds of acres of government land. The UP Police, emboldened by a court order to evict them, reached with 25 companies of PAC, the paramilitary wing and 4 companies of Rapid Action Force. But children and women were used as shields, which made their job difficult.</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-riots-hema-malini-akhilesh-yadav-bose-sena/1/683508.html " target="_blank">Baba Jai Gurudev, the godman whose followers are behind the Mathura riots</a> </b><br /></p><p>Sources say first firing happened from the splinter group of Jai Gurudev organisation that resulted in a death of <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/how-sho-santosh-yadav-came-to-be-known-as-mathuras-singham/1/683527.html " target="_blank">SHO Santosh Kumar Yadav</a>  on the spot and the city SP Mukul Dwivedi who succumbed to his injuries later. The police party that went to clear the area night long say there have been towers erected where the 'activists' positioned themselves with pistols. ADG Law and Order has said there have been use of crude bombs and land mines as well.</p><p><b>MASTERMIND IDENTIFIED</b></p><p>The Mathura Police has launched a massive manhunt for Ramvriksh Yadav, who is believed to be the mastermind of yesterday's violence. According to official sources, it was Yadav who had provoked people inside Jawahar Bagh to attack the police contingent.</p><p>Twelve teams have been formed to nab Yadav, however, the police has had little success so far.</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/mathura-violence-all-you-need-to-know/1/683514.html " target="_blank">Watch: All you need to know Mathura violence</a> </b><br /></p><p>Over 2500 people were inside Jawahar Bagh when the police launched the anti-encroachment drive to push out the illegal occupants who have been living there for the past two years. Police and local administration had tried to clear the place but failed.</p><p><b>AKHILESH ADMITS LAPSES</b></p><p>Acknowledging that the police was ill-prepared to tackle the land grabbers, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said no guilty will be spared. </p><p>He said that the police should have been "more prepared" before trying to evict the protesters.</p><p>"There were some lapses. Police should have gone with full preparation and after holding talks, but there was no information that they would be having so much (arms and ammunition)," Akhilesh told reporters.</p><p>A probe panel has been formed under supervision of the Commissioner of Aligarh who will submit report on the whole incident.</p><p>"Will see the (UP government's)report. This shouldn't have happened, UP government should look into why this happened. Bahut badi chook hui hai (There has been a big lapse)," Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said.

</p><p><b> DGP REFUSES TO ADMIT INTELLIGENCE FAILURE</b></p><p>Today morning DGP of Uttar Pradesh Javeed Ahmed said, "Huge cache of arms recovered in Mathura 45 arms of 315 bore, two 12 bore one factory made." Later in an interview to India Today he refused to accept it was an intelligence failure. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has ordered him and the Principal Secretary(Home) to visit Mathura to access the situation.</p><p><b>POLITICAL SLUGFEST OVER RIOTS</b></p><p>The BJP has upped the political heat on the ruling Samajwadi Party government over this incident terming the Akhilesh's rule as&nbsp; 'Maha Jungleraaj'. </p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/how-sho-santosh-yadav-came-to-be-known-as-mathuras-singham/1/683527.html " target="_blank">How SHO Santosh Yadav came to be known as Mathura's Singham</a>  </b><br /></p><p>BJP national secretary Shrikant is in Mathura and will submit a report on Thursday's violence to party president Amit Shah. Speaking to India Today, he demanded a CBI inquiry into the matter and has alleged role of a 'top SP leader' in the land grab.</p><p>With Assembly elections slated next year, even the otherwise insignificant players like Aam Admi Party is sending a delegation to Mathura tomorrow. </p><p>But probably amid this discourse the most noticeable perceived insensitivity was shown by local <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-burns-mp-hema-malini-fiddles-with-shooting-pics-on-twitter-quickly-deletes-them/1/683466.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-burns-mp-hema-malini-fiddles-with-shooting-pics-on-twitter-quickly-deletes-them/1/683466.html">MP Hema Malini who tweeted about her upcoming movie</a> . After being criticised for this she deleted all her tweets and planning to visit the city tomorrow to undo the damage.</p><p><b>Also Read:</b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-burns-mp-hema-malini-fiddles-with-shooting-pics-on-twitter-quickly-deletes-them/1/683466.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-burns-mp-hema-malini-fiddles-with-shooting-pics-on-twitter-quickly-deletes-them/1/683466.html">Mathura burns, MP Hema Malini fiddles with shooting pics on Twitter, quickly deletes them</a> </b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-violence-dm-rajesh-kumar-ssp-rakesh-kumar-suspended-for-negligence/1/683559.html " target="_blank">Mathura violence: 11 rioters died in fire set to their own shacks</a> </b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
