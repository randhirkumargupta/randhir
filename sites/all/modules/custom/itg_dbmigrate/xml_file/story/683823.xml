<storykicker><![CDATA[Former world number one Lee Chong Wei had to battle for three sets in the men's final while Tai Tzu Ying cruised to victory in her summit clash at the Indonesia Open on Sunday.<br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Veteran Malaysian shuttler Lee Chong Wei and Chinese Taipei's rising star Tai Tzu Ying won the men's singles and women's singles titles respectively in the Indonesia Open Superseries here on Sunday.</p><p>Chong Wei came from behind to beat Danish fifth seed Jan Jorgensen 17-21, 21-19, 21-17 in an hour and 13 minutes for his sixth Indonesia Open crown.</p><p>Jorgensen, the 5th seed, said he was disappointed for the defeat because he could have won the game if he had grabbed the crucial point in the second game, reports Xinhua.</p><p>"I came in the match really strong in the beginning. In the second game I got the chance in the end (to win the match) after leading at 19-17, but I blew it. I am disappointed right now, I thought I have the game in my hand. I thought I would have won, but he was really strong," said Jorgensen, the winner of 2014 Indonesia Open, after the match.</p><p>World No.2 Chong Wei didn't attend the press conference as he had to rush to the airport to catch his flight. The former World No.1 pocketed $67,500 for the title, with runner-up Jorgensen receiving $34,200 dollars.</p><p>Chong Wei now has a 15-1 advantage in career meetings against World No.5 Jorgensen. The Danish shuttler's only win came in 2009 at the China Open.</p><p><b>TAI TZU EASES TO VICTORY</b></p><p>In the women's singles contest, Tai stunned former world champion Yihan Wang of China 21-17, 21-8 in just 34 minutes at the landmark badminton stadium of Istora Senayan.</p><p>World No.9 Tai, 21, now leads 5-3 against No.3 Yihan in a head-to-head record.</p><p>In the men's doubles final, South Korea's Lee Yong Dae and Yoo Yeon Seong defeated China's Chai Biao and Hong Wei 13-21, 21-13, 21-16 in an hour and 13 minutes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Japanese women's doubles players Misaki Matsutomo and Ayaka Takahashi edged China's Tang Yuanting and Yu Yang 21-15, 8-21, 21-15 to lift their first Indonesian Open title.</p><p>The Japanese pair walked away with a prize of $71,000 U.S. dollars while the Chinese duo earned $34,000.</p><p>Ayaka said the victory came after they well adjusted their game in the one hour and six minute final.</p><p>"The wind in the arena backlashed our shots, slowing down the ball in the second game. So we tried our best for not to get influenced by this situation in the third game and it was apparently successful," Ayaka said.</p><p>In the mixed doubles final, Chinese pair of Xu Chen and Ma Jin successfully defended their title as they defeated South Korean Ko Sung Hyun and Kim Ha Na 21-15, 16-21, 21-13 in 58 minutes.</p><p>"We experienced difficulties in the match as the South Korean players played very fast. We were exhausted and committed many mistakes in the second set. We managed to regain control in the third game," Xu Chen told a press conference.</p><p>Xu said that they are now focusing on the upcoming Australia Open on June 7 through to 12 and then the all important Rio Olympics in August.</p>]]></storybody>
