<storykicker><![CDATA[Demanding the withdrawal of compensation given by the Uttar Pradesh government to Mohammed Akhlaq's family, kin of the 18 arrested on the charge of lynching, are planning to file a formal complaint with the police.<br /><br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>There's an uneasy calm in Bisada village after a fresh forensic report said the meat recovered from the site of Mohammad Akhlaq's murder was beef. When the Mail Today team visited the village, the uneasiness was evident. Everywhere the team went, various sets of eyes followed. </p><p>Fifty-two-year-old Mohammed Akhlaq was lynched by an unruly mob on September 28, 2015, in Dadri over rumours that his family stored and ate beef. Demanding the withdrawal of compensation given by the Uttar Pradesh government to Mohammed Akhlaq's family, kin of the 18 arrested on the charge of lynching, are planning to file a formal complaint with the police.</p><p><b>UNREST</b></p><p>Since the last September incident, the village has been declared as a hyper-sensitive zone and when the Mail Today team visited the village a huge number of police deployments were seen on ground. Villagers are reluctant to talk to mediapersons and were also seen questioning the credibility of the coverage. </p><p>"I don't want to discuss what happened that night. We condemn both slaughter of cow and Akhlaq's murder. But, government's investigation was one sided. Some innocents were even picked up by the cops," said a Muslim barber near the primary school. He added that no violence or discrimination took place after the lynching incident, but stated that relation between the Hindus and Muslims, in the village, is not harmonious as before.</p><p>Now, the families of the accused, who are in jail for Akhlaq's murder, claim to be the real victims. "This is not the first time that we are demanding an investigation and action behind cow slaughter. I have written to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the DGP and DM and SSP of the district but no one has responded. </p><p>It was only after Mathura's forensic lab report that authenticated that the meat found at Akhlaq's residence was beef, we are demanding action against his family," said Sanjay Rana, a villager whose 22-year-old son, Vishal, has been in jail for the past eight months. Locals said that they trusted the judiciary and would continue fighting constitutionally. </p><p>They threatened to take out a mass protest, after seeking support from their community members residing in nearby villages, if the state machinery tries to suppress the matter. "This incident has not only affected our village but has also hurt the sentiments of our community members residing elsewhere. We have received several calls expressing grief and confirming support to our fight to ensure justice for our children," said Rajpal Singh whose, son Arun, was held in the case. "Bisada is a peaceful village, the only family to leave this village was Akhlaq's. But things have changed. Earlier, Hindus used to give us loans and accompany us in religious functions but now they avoid us," said a Muslim labourer.</p><p>However, Akhlaq's family maintains that it has not seen the forensic report yet. Terming the report a political conspiracy, Akhlaq's brother, Jaan Mohammad, who works with a private company, said, "No police officer collected the meat sample from our house. The sample was collected from the road."</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-the-meat-in-victims-house-was-beef-says-forensic-report/1/682162.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-the-meat-in-victims-house-was-beef-says-forensic-report/1/682162.html">Also read: Dadri lynching: The meat in victim's house was beef, says forensic report </a> </b></p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
