<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is excited about the new era that is about to begin at his club with coach Jose Mourinho.</p><p>The former Chelsea manager last week signed a contract until June 2019 with the record 20-times English champions.</p><p>"To speak of Jose Mourinho is to talk about a winning coach and that is United's philosophy and mine," De Gea told Marca on Friday.</p><p>"With that idea in mind, I'm certain we can build a great team. I welcome him."</p><p>Titles have been scarce for De Gea since the Spaniard moved to Manchester from Atletico Madrid in 2011.</p><p>He won the Premier League in 2012-13, Alex Ferguson's last season in charge of the team. David Moyes was then sacked 10 months after replacing Ferguson and his successor was Louis Van Gaal.</p><p>United finished fourth in the Premier League in the 2014-15 campaign and were eliminated from the Champions League in the group stages this season.</p><p>They were fifth in the league and must settle for the Europa League, but they did lift the FA Cup last month.</p><p><b>'WINNING IS EVERYTHING AT UNITED'</b></p><p>"When you speak of United nothing is enough if you don't win every title," De Gea said.</p><p>"Not qualifying to the Champions League was a big blow but we have won the FA Cup after 12 years, and after three years without lifting a trophy.</p><p>"We must value this because it's a very important trophy for the fans. This FA Cup should be the launchpad for the club to win important titles."</p><p>De Gea, 25, was close to leaving Manchester last year for Real Madrid but the clubs did not complete the deal before the transfer deadline.</p><p>He signed a new contract with United until 2019 but speculation about his future has continued.</p><p>"There's a lot of talk but little is known," De Gea said. "I understand how things work but what I feel is disrespectful is for someone to speak on my behalf. I have three further years left on my contract with United and I'm enthusiastic to win titles there."</p><p>De Gea is training with the Spain squad in preparation for Euro 2016.</p>]]></storybody>
