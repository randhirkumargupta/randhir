<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Generations of Goans who enjoyed easy access to Europe through their Portuguese ties may now have to give up the privilege of holding a 'Bill of Identity' granted by Portugal to retain their Indian citizenship. </p><p>The dual identities of thousands of Goans had created confusion over citizenship issues. People from Goa could travel to Portugal on an Indian passport and with the Bill of Identity granted by the country, they could travel across all European Union states without a visa. Former Goa chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, who is now the defence minister in the Narendra Modi government, had flagged the issue. </p><p>Parrikar had asked the Centre to look into the matter as around four lakh Goans had registered their names in Portugal's Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Death that gave them the Bill of Identity. </p><p><b>HOW TO DECIDE CITIZENSHIP?</b>&nbsp; <br /></p><p>An inter-ministerial committee, headed by additional secretary in the home ministry, BK Prasad, has recommended that the issue of citizenship of such persons should be decided as per the Citizenship Act 1955 and Citizenship Rules 2009. It has recommended setting up of a designated authority that should examine each case as per Indian laws. </p><p>"They will have a choice of either relinquishing their Portuguese identity or hold on to Indian passports," said a home ministry official.<br /><b><br />BENEFITS <br /></b><br />As per Portuguese law, those who register their names in the Central Registry, are given rights to purchase property in the country. "Many people are ignorant and became victims as they were lured by the option of having a document from Portugal that allowed them easy access to Europe without a visa," said a home ministry official.</p><p> Several public servants, including MLAs and MPs, have registered their names in the Central Registry, which they claim was not been done by them or done without their knowledge. </p><p>After going through various deliberations, evidence and records available, the interministerial committee felt that if any question arises as to whether, when and how any citizen of India has acquired the citizenship of another country, it should be determined by provisions of Citizenship Act 1955 and Citizenship Rules 2009. </p><p><b>PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS</b>&nbsp; <br /></p><p>The panel recommended that the issue of citizenship of such persons will be decided by an authority designated by the central government after receiving representations that have been enquired upon, in a just, fair, reasonable and transparent manner. Thereafter, a report will be submitted to the central government along with recommendations for necessary action. </p><p>The inter-ministerial committee suggested that whosoever has acquired a Portuguese passport automatically became citizen of Portugal and ceased to be an Indian citizen. </p><p>To determine nationality status of all such persons who were born before December 20, 1961, when Goa became independent from Portuguese rule, in the territories comprising the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, an order called the Goa Daman and Diu (Citizenship) order 1962 was issued through a notification dated March 28, 1962. </p><p>According to the aforesaid notification, every person, who or either of whose parents or any of whose grandparents was born before December 20, 1961 in the territories now comprised in the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu became a citizen of India on that day, if the person did not opt to retain the citizenship or nationality which he had immediately before December 20, 1961. </p><p>Subsequently, many Goans who became citizens of India as per Goa, Daman and Diu (Citizenship) order 1961, registered their birth in the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>]]></storybody>
