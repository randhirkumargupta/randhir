<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The trailer launch of the upcoming Bollywood Dishoom was quite a big bang affair, living up to the film's title. The stars had a rollicking time introducing their film to a crowded audience at a suburban Mumbai theatre on Wednesday evening. Looking gorgeous in a figure-hugging ensemble, the film's heroine Jacqueline Fernandez did an impromptu act as emcee and taking over the formality of introducing her co-stars. </p><p>Jacqueline in fact seemed in a merry mood, liberally frolicking with Varun Dhawan, one of the two heroes of Dishoom. It remains to be seen what sort of chemistry the two young stars strike in the film, but at Wednesday's do, Jacqueline and Varun were quite in their elements, giving liberal photo-ops to the gathered shutterbugs. The film's other hero John Abraham cut quite a macho picture in a tight tee that complimented his bulging brawn, although Jacqueline seemed more interested in openly admiring the biceps of Varun. Was it because Dishoom is Varun's home production and has been directed by his elder brother, Rohit Dhawan? Only Jackie knows. </p><p><b>ROHIT DHAWAN'S SECOND FILM </b></p><p>This is Rohit's second release as director after Desi Boyz, which saw middling success a while back. The young director, whose dad David Dhawan has been one of the biggest filmmakers in Bollywood of the nineties, arrived with wife Jaanvi Desai and seemed optimistic his new film would break a few records. Akshay Khanna, who makes a comeback with this film after a hiatus, made a rare public appearance at the do. Mostly sticking to his reserved image, Akshay was seen quietly posing for a few photo-ops with the film's producer Sajid Nadiadwala. </p><p><b>DISHOOM IS ROHIT'S MADNESS PROJECT</b> <br /></p><p>Describing Dishoom as a product of his brother Rohit's madness, Varun said the film was meant to entertain across the board. The film has Saqib Saleem playing a star Indian cricketer who goes missing in UAE days before a big match against Pakistan. John plays a special task force officer who is assigned the job of leading a mission to track down the player. Varun plays the only man who can help him. Akshaye Khanna plays the kidnapper while Nargis Fakhri has a cameo. Jacqueline is said to have a dual role in the film, slated for a July 29 release, and her formalities will include most of the song-dance routine even as the men engage in big bang action.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/gallery/dishoom-trailer-launch-john-abraham-varun-dhawan-jacqueline-fernandez-muscle-flaunting-affair-photos/1/17654.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/gallery/dishoom-trailer-launch-john-abraham-varun-dhawan-jacqueline-fernandez-muscle-flaunting-affair-photos/1/17654.html">Also see: Dishoom trailer launch: A muscle-flaunting affair for John, Varun, Jacqueline</a></b> </p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
