<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Muhammad Ali found nothing wrong in bragging about himself being the best. In his heyday, powered by his fast fists, Ali captivated the world.<br />&nbsp;<br />The three-time world heavyweight boxing champion, who died aged 74 earlier today in Phoenix after battling the Parkinson's disease for over three decades, was also known for coming up with witty one-liners that won him more adulation. <br />&nbsp;<br />"My name is known in Serbia, Pakistan, Morocco. These are countries that don't follow the Kentucky Derby." These words were said by Ali during a New York Times interview in 1977. <br />&nbsp;<br />Ali took pride in his growing fanbase. His stature as a global sporting icon grew after his battles with Joe Frazier. <br /></p><p>It was common knowledge that Ali had hardcore fans around the globe and India was no exception. From Bollywood superstars to the lawmakers, quite a few couldn't resist the urge to meet him.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here are a few instances that showcase the fandom Ali enjoyed in India<br /><b>&nbsp;<br />ALI TAKES ON NATIONAL HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION IN DELHI</b><br />&nbsp;<br />Ali had visited India during the mid-seventies. He shared the ring in an exhibition match with the then Indian national heavyweight champion Kaur Singh at the National Stadium in New Delhi.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sports journalist Norris Pritam, in his article for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firstpost.com/sports/from-muhammad-alis-india-visit-to-atlanta-olympics-the-greatests-legend-lives-on-2816884.html?utm_source=fp_top_internal"><b>firstpost,</b> </a> recollects his experience of watching Ali in action. "As a young runner training at the National Stadium, I had the privilege to witness the bout that was actually no match. Ali simply kept penning his right hand to block punches from Kaur Singh and was talking to us youngsters standing at the ringside. Later, on the insistence of a seven-year-old boy we went up the stage and poked fingers in his ribs to see whether he was bone and muscles or steel!"<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>MOHAMMAD RAFI STRIKES AN UPPERCUT POSE WITH ALI</b><br />&nbsp;<br />Veteran playback singer Mohammad Rafi was known to be one of the biggest fanboys of the champion boxer. Rafi didn't miss the opportunity to meet Ali while on his tour of the United States. In fact, the celebrated vocalist made the most of his meeting with Ali by posing for a snap in which he was seen landing an uppercut on the boxer's face. </p><blockquote data-twitter-extracted-i1465058000946937495="true" data-twitter-extracted-i1465038215964486645="true" class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"We will pose like this.

Bachchan had met Ali at his house in Los Angeles during the eighties along with filmmaker, producer Prakash Mehra. The Bollywood star revealed in a Tweet that Mehra was ready to make a film with him and Ali.<blockquote data-twitter-extracted-i1465058000946937495="true" data-twitter-extracted-i1465038215964486645="true" class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">T 2277 -With the 'greatest' Muhammed Ali at his home in L.A.

As Ali and superstar-turned politician MG Ramachandran held hands at the Nehru Stadium in erstwhile Madras, the crowd went berserk.<br />&nbsp;<br />Ali fought with heavyweight champion Jimmy Ellis at the iconic stadium in the city and a sea of crowd had gathered to watch the fight, according to The Hindu. <br />&nbsp;<br />A senior lawyer from Chennai, Rabu Manohar, recollected his most-cherished experience of watching two of his most favourites icons in a single frame. He says the crowd gathered there were more interested in their local hero MGR.<blockquote data-twitter-extracted-i1465058000946937495="true" data-twitter-extracted-i1465038215964486645="true" class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rare pic- Dr.MGR &amp; Muhammad Ali.Team Bhooloham salutes the legends on their bday today <a href="https://twitter.com/actor_jayamravi">@actor_jayamravi</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/trishtrashers">@trishtrashers</a> <a href="http://t.co/4ZDT9sKG">pic.twitter.com/4ZDT9sKG</a></p>�??

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>"We actually went to see MGR, MGR was our hero then. But it was amazing to see Muhammad Ali.

"He had come here on a personal invitation and visited the club. He also showed us some tricks... I fondly remember how he would float in the air but later would reveal the trick," former club president Sulaiman Khurshid told PTI.<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
