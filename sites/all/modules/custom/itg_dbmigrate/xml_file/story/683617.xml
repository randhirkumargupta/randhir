 continues to reside in 7, Circular Road which was allotted to him after
 Manjhi had taken over as the chief minister two years ago.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>It is a tale of two bungalows, both occupied by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar. Nitish has been keeping two sprawling bungalows in Patna ever since his predecessor Jitan Ram Manjhi vacated the 1, Anne Marg house in June last year. </p><p>However, the chief minister is yet to shift to the official bungalow and continues to reside in 7, Circular Road which was allotted to him after Manjhi had taken over as the chief minister two years ago.</p><p><b>OPPOSITION QUESTIONS NITISH'S DECISION<br /></b></p><p>Allotment of two bungalows to Nitish by the state government has irked the Opposition in Bihar. Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sushil Kumar Modi questioned the motive of Nitish in keeping the two houses. "What is the need for Nitish to occupy the two bungalows?" he asked. "Why two houses have been allotted to somebody who is averse to dynastic politics and lives with his only son?"</p><p>The former deputy chief minister wondered whether Nitish was apprehensive about the completion of his five-year term. "That is why he has got the 7, Circular Road bungalow allotted in his name as a former chief minister," he said.</p><p>Sushil said when 1, Anne Marg was already designated as the official bungalow of the chief minister, what was the rationale to allocate another bungalow in Nitish's name. He said that even Rashtriya Janata Dal president and former chief minister Lalu Prasad had been residing in a single bungalow with his wife Rabri Devi, a former chief minister as well as their two sons Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who happened to be the ministers in the Nitish Kumar government. The BJP leader said the chief minister had occupied two bungalows at a time when there was a scarcity of houses even for the ministers in Patna. He said that many old quarters meant for them and the legislators had been razed to the ground by the government to construct new ones.</p><p>The ruling Janata Dal-United, however, hit back at Sushil. Party spokesman Sanjay Singh said that the BJP leader had forgotten the fact that Chief minister Vasundhara Raje had also been occupying two bungalows in Rajasthan where their party was in the government. "Sushil Modi's dreams were not fulfilled in the Bihar elections," he said. "That is why he has started day-dreaming about the chief ministerial bungalow."</p><p>Accusing Sushil of having least knowledge about the rules and norms, Sanjay said that 1, Anne Marg was being used as the Chief minister's secretariat for disposal of work related to different departments now. "How can one live in a house where official work is done?" he asked. Bihar's deputy chief minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who heads the building construction ministry which allocates the bungalows, said that Sushil had resorted to low-level politics after he failed to get the BJP's nomination for the Rajya Sabha seat recently.<br /></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-arts-topper-ruby-rai-skips-re-examination-on-health-grounds/1/683587.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-arts-topper-ruby-rai-skips-re-examination-on-health-grounds/1/683587.html">Also read: </a><a target="_blank">Bihar topper, who said political science is about cooking, skips re-examination</a></b>  </p>]]></storybody>
