<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Director Anurag Kashyap says that he considers all his films commercial but cannot make films such as Sultan and Dishoom, though he liked their trailers.</p><p>At the launch of the song Qatl-E-Aam from his upcoming film Raman Raghav 2.0, Anurag was asked if he liked the trailer of superstar Salman Khan's Sultan. </p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sultan-if-not-for-salman-khan-randeep-hooda-wouldnt-have-done-the-film/1/681503.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sultan-if-not-for-salman-khan-randeep-hooda-wouldnt-have-done-the-film/1/681503.html"><u><b>ALSO READ: If not for Salman Khan, Randeep Hooda wouldn't have done Sultan</b></u></a></p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sultan-salman-khan-anushka-sharma-budapest-shooting-wrestling-capital-europe/1/682460.html "><u><b>ALSO READ: Sultan is taking Salman Khan, Anushka Sharma to the wrestling capital of Europe</b></u></a>  <br /></p><p>"I saw the trailer and in every trailer you enjoy it. I even enjoyed 'Dishoom' a lot, but the problem with me is that I can't make them," he said.</p><p>The trailers of Sultan and Varun Dhawan, John Abraham starrer Dishoom were launched recently and have already registered views in millions. </p><p>The films can be called masala entertainers, while Anurag is known for his realistic films such as Black Friday and his other films, too, like Gangs of Wasseypur have a different style and can't perhaps be termed masalaa films.</p><p>His last film Bombay Velvet had a massive budget but it failed at the box office. Considering the failure, is there a bigger pressure on him to deliver with Raman Raghav 2.0.</p><p>"That happens with every film. We want every film to work well. But with Raman Raghav 2.0 there is not that much pressure as was in the previous film. Our last film (Bombay Velvet) was Titanic. This film is our boat," Anurag said.</p><p>When asked if he would make another commercial film like Bombay Velvet, the director said,"All films are commercial for me. Whenever I make films, I think in commercial terms."</p><p>Anurag usually shoots in real locations but for Bombay Velvet he had to shoot on sets. About going back to real locations and going back to his genre with Raman Raghav 2.0, he said, "I have never gone out of my genre. I have always made films that I always wanted to make. Regarding locations, our focus is whenever we get anything, we maximise it."</p><p>Raman Raghav 2.0 stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Vicky Kaushal in lead roles.</p>]]></storybody>
