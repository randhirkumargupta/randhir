<storykicker><![CDATA[Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has slammed the sexism faced by men in the showbiz world. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>He apologised for his on screen death, he expressed his profuse love for his lady love, he avoided a speeding ticket by giving out a major Game of Thrones spoiler and now, actor Kit Harington has gone ahead and slammed the 'double standards' of the glamour industry. </p><p>Harington, who shot to fame for his portrayal of Jon Snow in popular fantasy fiction series Game of Thrones, feels that contrary to popular belief, men in the showbiz world also face sexism.</p><p>"I like to think of myself as more than a head of hair or a set of looks. It is demeaning. Yes, in some ways you could argue I have been employed for a look I have. But there's sexism that happens towards men," The Sunday Times UK quotes Harington saying.</p><p><b>Also Read: <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jon-snow-kit-harington-love-romamce-game-of-thrones-ygritte-rose-leslie/1/668162.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jon-snow-kit-harington-love-romamce-game-of-thrones-ygritte-rose-leslie/1/668162.html"><u>Kit Harington just said the sweetest thing about his on and off-screen girlfriend Rose Leslie</u></a> </b></p><p>Elucidating on how he wants to be seen "as more than a head of hair or a set of looks" Harington reveals that he's personally been subjected to objectification and sexism. </p><p>Labelling the practice as "demeaning" the actor further adds, "There's definitely a sexism in our industry that happens towards women, and there is towards men as well..At some points during photoshoots when I'm asked to strip down, I felt that."</p><p>"It's not just men that can be inappropriate sexually; women can be as well. I'm in a successful TV show in a kind of leading man way and it can sometimes feel like your art is being put to one side for your sex appeal. And I don't like that," he adds. </p><p><b>Also Read: <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kit-harington-apologises-to-fans-for-lying-about-jon-snows-death-game-of-thrones-season-6-melisandre/1/657792.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kit-harington-apologises-to-fans-for-lying-about-jon-snows-death-game-of-thrones-season-6-melisandre/1/657792.html"><u>Game of Thrones: Kit Harington apologises to fans for lying about Jon Snow's death</u></a><u> </u></b></p><p>While some are appreciating Harington's stand, some others have&nbsp;criticised&nbsp;the actor's comments. </p><p>"I think what he is actually describing is feeling objectified, which certainly isn't a phenomenon belonging to a single gender," The Guardian quotes feminist blog Jezebel saying. <br /></p>]]></storybody>
