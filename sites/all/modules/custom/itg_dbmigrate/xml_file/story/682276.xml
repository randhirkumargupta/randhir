<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A lot of travellers share the dream of climbing Switzerland's Alps mountains someday. While it's an amazing thing to look forward to, here's something more you will be able to do when you are there. Not too long from now, you will be able to ride a train that will take you through the longest and deepest tunnel in the world.</p><p>Yes, you read that right. After 17 years of construction, Switzerland has opened the 57.1-km-long Gotthard Base Tunnel that has a railway line running through the heart of the Alps mountain. {mosimage}</p><p>Designed to last for a century, the construction of this tunnel is a part of 23 billion Swiss franc infrastructure project that aims to reduce the travel time between northern and southern Europe through railway lines under the mountains.</p><p><b>Also see: <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/gallery/switzerland-travel-world-gotthard-base-tunnel/1/17646.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/gallery/switzerland-travel-world-gotthard-base-tunnel/1/17646.html">The tunnel in pictures</a></b>  <br /></p><p>The overall project includes the Loetschberg rail tunnel that has already opened, the Cereti tunnel that is still being built, and renovations to make rail tunnels that are at least four metres high at the corners to be able to handle big freight containers. Work is due to finish in 2020. The mammoth rail venture is being financed by value-added and fuel taxes, road charges on heavy vehicles and state loans that are due to be repaid within a decade. {mosimage}</p><p>Around 260 freight trains and 65 passenger trains will traverse the two-tube tunnel daily once final testing ends later this year. It is believed that high-speed trains will take only 17 minutes to cover the 57.1 km stretch of the tunnel.</p><p>The construction of such a tunnel was never easy. Engineers had to dig and blast through 73 kinds of rock as hard as granite and as soft as sugar. Nine workers died. {mosimage}</p><p>While people eagerly await a ride through this tunnel, the first ones to travel the tunnel at the official opening will be 500 lucky winners plus guests from the 1,30,000 people who entered a ticket lottery for the inaugural trip.</p><p><i>(With inputs from Reuters)</i></p>]]></storybody>
