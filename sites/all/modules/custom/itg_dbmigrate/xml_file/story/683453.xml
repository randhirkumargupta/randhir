<storykicker><![CDATA[Dr Jan Mohammad believes fathering 100 children will get him a guaranteed spot in heaven. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Meet 43-year-old Jan Mohammad from Pakistan, a doctor by profession, who is already a father of 35 children and is steadfast to fulfill his goal of having 100 children. </p><p>He strongly believes that fathering 100 children will ensure a spot for him in heaven, and he's already a third of the way there. Sardar Jan Mohammad Khilji already has three wives and is on the look out for the fourth. </p><p><b>The practice of polygamy in conservative Muslim countries is rare but still prevalent.</b></p><p> According to Islam, men are allowed to marry up to four women. Speaking to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/1000761/pakistani-father-of-35-aims-for-100-children" mce_href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/1000761/pakistani-father-of-35-aims-for-100-children">AFP,</a>  Rafia Zakaria, a women's rights activist, said the Koran dictates that a man can have more than one wife provided he can mete out 'perfect justice' among them. </p><p>However, this idea of 'perfect justice' is utopic to say the least. According to Rafia Zakaria, "Perfect justice is impossible, and for this reason polygamy is never a good situation. Someone always suffers and almost always it is the women and children"</p><p> <b>"The bigger the family, the better,"</b> he told<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1242867"> Dawn</a>, a Pakistani daily. </p><p>His family lives in a 12 room mud house in the outskirts of Quetta. Jan who makes a living from an unregulated clinic, treats 
patients for minor ailments, and gets paid rupees 250 per session. He treats
 the poor for free.</p><p>He says, "I want to have 100 children, as the prophet had said that those who increase the number of followers (of Islam) will never go to hell," he said. "With the grace of God, my children will help me go to heaven."</p><p><b>Facebook marriage in the offing </b><br /></p><p>&nbsp;With whatever he earns, he fulfills all the needs of each one of his children (or so he believes) and does not discriminate between his sons and daughters. In fact, his favorite child is his eldest daughter, Shagufta Nasreen, who studies in the ninth grade. </p><p>The only downside, he confessed, is that he sometimes forgets all his children's names.</p><p>Ever since his story aired in Pakistani media, Jan Mohammad has been flooded with marriage proposals via social media. He might just land up finding his next match through Facebook. <br /></p>]]></storybody>
