<storykicker><![CDATA[A 13-year-old boy from a village in Maharashtra had a peculiar condition of head hung at a 180 degree angle due to congenital myopathy. He received help from a woman living in Liverpool who never had any connection with him or his family.&nbsp; ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Mahindra Ahirwar was born with a rare condition called congenital myopathy which refers to muscle disorders in infants. In Mahindra's case, his neck muscles were so weak that it could not hold his head like normal people but hung at a 180 degree angle. <br /></p><p>He's now a 13-year-old but quite obviously not like other kids his age. His condition kept him in constant pain and he was dependent on friends and family throughout. His suffering was such that even his parents wished for his death. </p><p>Mahindra's parents, Mukesh and Sumitra, took him to over 50 doctors in India but to no avail. Every doctor they met said any attempt at a corrective surgery could kill the boy. </p><p>{mosimage} <br /></p><p><b>They didn't know their fate was destined to change. </b></p><p>Julie Jones, a mother-of-two from Liverpool, read about Mahindra's rare medical condition and was determined to change his life forever. She set up a crowd funding campaign and raised 9 lakh rupees for Mahindra's treatment. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, Mahindra and family were taken to Delhi's Apollo Hospital. World famous spinal surgeon, Dr Rajagopalan Krishnan, conducted a corrective surgery on Mahindra where he removed the disks from his neck and replaced those with a bone graft from his pelvis. </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mahindra has now got metal plates to support to ensure the neck remains straight and will also have to wear a brace for another 6 months. He now breathes easier and eats and drinks on his own. He has also started to play with his friends and is learning how to write. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>{mosimage} </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Watch a video about Mahindra's story here:</b></p><p><br /></p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYIfVs7izhA" mce_src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYIfVs7izhA" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="647"></iframe></div><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
