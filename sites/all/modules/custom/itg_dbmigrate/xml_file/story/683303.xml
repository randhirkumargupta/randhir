<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The researchers from the University of California - Los Angeles in their recent study have concluded that for teenagers seeing large numbers of "likes" on their own photos or the photos of peers on a social networking site is as pleasing as eating chocolates. </p><p>In the study published in the journal Psychological Science, the 
researchers claimed that in teenagers similar brain circuits are 
activated by seeing a large number of likes on their 
photos as by eating chocolate. </p><p><b>IT'S MY LIKE</b></p><p>With the sample size of 32 teenagers, aged 13-18, the study tried to observe the brain activation by using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or FMRI.</p><p>In an experiment, the sample group was shown 148 photographs on a computer screen for 12 minutes, including 40 photos that each teenager submitted.</p><p>Each photo also displayed the number of likes it had supposedly received from other teenage participants. However, these likes were assigned by the researchers.<br /><b><br />EVERYONE LIKES A 'LIKE'</b></p><p>According to researchers, when teenagers saw their own photos with large number of likes, a region in the brain called the nucleus accumbens was stimulated. This region of the brain is part of the brain's reward circuitry. </p><p>This circuitry is thought to be particularly sensitive during adolescence.</p><p>"When the teenagers saw their own photos with a large number of likes, we saw activity across a wide variety of regions in the brain," said lead author Lauren Sherman. </p><p><b>ALSO READ:</b><br /><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/facebook-announces-text-understanding-engine-deeptext/1/683244.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/facebook-announces-text-understanding-engine-deeptext/1/683244.html">Facebook announces text understanding engine DeepText</a> </b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/dozens-in-russia-imprisoned-for-social-media-likes-reposts/1/682382.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/dozens-in-russia-imprisoned-for-social-media-likes-reposts/1/682382.html">Dozens in Russia imprisoned for social media likes, reposts </a> </b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
