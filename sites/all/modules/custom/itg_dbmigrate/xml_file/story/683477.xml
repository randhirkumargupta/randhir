<storykicker><![CDATA["Lucid dreaming and chill" might become a reality in near future for people across the world like it is already for a few in Kiev, Ukraine, Eastern Europe. Here's the story of Kiev Dreamers, a bunch of dream enthusiasts who claim they've successfully built a device and an application that will help people walk into lucid dreaming at will. <br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>If you've seen Hollywood director Christopher Nolan's masterpiece 'Inception', you would know what lucid dreaming is. For the uninitiated, a lucid dream is a dream in which you are aware that you are dreaming. What makes it complex and interesting is that you can take control of the dream you are in, of the characters in the dream, of the narrative, of the environment and even change it at will. <br /></p><p>A Ukranian company - <b>Luciding</b> - has been experimenting with lucid dreaming for years now and they're at a stage confident enough to offer their product to the world, a product using which you will be able to practice lucid dreaming. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p><br />A beautifully shot and well directed short documentary on Luciding and its staff tells us the story of three people who hope to make life better for others. The documentary is called Kiev Dreamers. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>{mosimage}<br /> </p><p>Nikita, CEO of Luciding, says he's been experimenting with lucid dreaming for over 5 years and has been practicing it every single day. He started Luciding to help everyone share the experience. </p><p>Michael, CTO of Luciding, confesses he wasn't aware of the possibilities of lucid dreaming before joining the company. He says "what you imagine instantly becomes a reality. It's your dream, your imagination, it's your fantasy."</p><p>Maryna, COO of Luciding, explains what lucid dreaming can offer. She says "you can time travel, see someone who you can't even imagine meeting, and you can ask questions about your life."</p><p>What forced these people to consider escaping reality is a question that should be asked. They have an answer for it, and we know of it if we remember what happened in Kiev two years ago - the <b>2014 Ukrainian revolution</b>. <br /></p><p>In February 2014, the lives of people in Ukraine, especially those who lived in Kiev, changed forever. Peaceful protests in Kiev abruptly turned violent resulting in bloodshed and the government was overthrown. </p><p><b>Here are a few images during protests and post the revolution</b> <br /></p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The war with the East started post this, pushing people in Kiev and Ukraine on the whole to an obvious not-so-happy phase in life. Maryna says people in Ukraine are trying to keep their lives normal and happy and are determined to not live in fear whatever happens. But there are many who are trying to escape reality, at least momentarily, and resort to alcohol and drugs for it. Luciding opposes that and wants to help them have a good sleep without having to depend on narcotics. <br /></p><p><b>What does Luciding's device do? </b><br /></p><p>Again reminding us of Inception, Luciding's device keeps a track of how long a person sleeps and stimulates the brain in such a way that it becomes aware the moment you start dreaming or as they say "when you're in a dream." They claim "at that moment, you can gain control over your dream and do anything you want," but agrees there will be a "minor electronic stimulation to the brain."</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p>Team Luciding say people who practice lucid dream always feel better because when you wake up from a lucid dream you remember how you were a master of the world and that you don't need to set any limitations for yourself. </p><p><b>What do people dream of?</b></p><p>Michael says usually the first lucid dream people make involves flying and going through objects, and gives passing through a wall as an example. Nikita says many people tell them they want to have sex with celebrities and he assures that "it is very easily possible in lucid dreaming."&nbsp; <br /></p><p><b>Watch Kiev Dreamers directed by David Fried right here:</b></p><div><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/165905922?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" mce_src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/165905922?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="338" width="640"></iframe>
