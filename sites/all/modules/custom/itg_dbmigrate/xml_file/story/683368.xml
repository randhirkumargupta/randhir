<storykicker><![CDATA[In the 2012 UP assembly elections, the RLD won 8 seats in UP and out of these 5 are from the Braj region, while the traditional Jat stronghold Meerut-Saharanpur zone could only deliver 3 seats to the party.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>As the political parties are busy preparing for the UP Assembly elections to be held in 2017, Jat strongman Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) is again planning to strike a pre-poll alliance with Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party (SP), seeking key Agra division seats, including almost entire Mathura district, as bargain.</p><p>Known as the stronghold of the RLD, the Braj region of UP is also the former parliamentary seat of party supremo Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chowdhary, who lost the seat to Hema Malini in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. Interestingly, before recently joining the SP, Amar Singh was also a member of RLD and had contested the 2014 election from Fatehpur Sikri seat on RLD ticket, in which he had to lose his deposit.</p><p><b>RLD'S HARD BARGAIN WITH SP </b><br /></p><p>Now, with Amar Singh in the SP, RLD supremo Ajit Singh is hoping for striking a new bargain with the Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, although the SP is not keen on giving up its claim on the key seats of Braj that Ajit Singh is expected to demand as a part of the bargain.</p><p>A simple calculation explains why Ajit Singh could ask for the Braj region seats. In the 2012 UP assembly elections, the RLD won 8 seats in UP and out of these 5 are from the Braj region, while the traditional Jat stronghold Meerut-Saharanpur zone could only deliver 3 seats to the party.</p><p>A local RLD leader told India Today that out of the 5 seats in Braj, the victory of RLD was almost confirmed on 4 - Maant, Baldeo, Goverdhan and Chhata, while in Aligarh, Khair, Iglas and Barauli seats were the most likely seats where RLD could score a win as on all these seats.</p><p><b>SP MAY NOT AGREE</b> <br /></p><p>Although the RLD does not hold much clout in Agra district's 9 seats, its candidates have seen some respectable scores on the Fatehpur Sikri, Kheragarh and Etmadpur seats and the RLD could demand these seats from the SP as well. This could become a trifle difficult for the SP to part from as the party has already declared candidates on almost all Agra seats.</p><p>According to the available analysis, in 2007 elections, the RLD had been on the second rank in the final tally in almost all the braj seats, while the SP had been relegated to the fourth position in four seats. The RLD got its candidate from Hathras elected to the assembly and even in the 2012 UP assembly elections and 2014 parliamentary elections, the RLD candidate's scores were quite better than those of the SP candidate.</p><p>Social activist Deep Sharma said that in the 2002 elections, the RLD had captured Mathura's Gokul and Chhata, Hathras' Sadabad and Agra's Fatehpur SIkri and Etmadpur seats and if the SP and RLD form a prepoll alliance, it is certain that the RLD will demand these seats and this could affect the electoral plans of several SP candidates.</p><p><b>ALSO READ</b>:&nbsp;<b> <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/up-elections-beni-prasad-verma-amar-singh-re-enter-samajwadi-party/1/668373.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/up-elections-beni-prasad-verma-amar-singh-re-enter-samajwadi-party/1/668373.html">UP elections: Beni Prasad Verma re-enters Samajwadi Party</a></b> <br /></p>]]></storybody>
