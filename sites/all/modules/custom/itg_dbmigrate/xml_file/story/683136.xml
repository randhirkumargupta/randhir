<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Three men allegedly thrashed a doctor and molested his wife after he objected to their drinking in a west Delhi restaurant's washroom in front of the couple's eight-year-old child.</p><p>The incident took place on Sunday night at The Burger Club in Rajouri Garden, but police failed to act for three days despite dozens of witnesses and security camera footage backing up the allegations, the victims say.</p><p>However, within hours of Mail Today asking senior officials of the district about the matter, a case was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for molestation, criminal intimidation, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees of the eatery, including a female manager, intervened and pushed the accused out of the establishment.</p><p>The victims have alleged that a PCR van reached the spot almost 40 minutes after they called the emergency number "100" multiple times.</p><p>"We have registered a case under appropriate IPC sections and have asked the eatery to provide us the CCTV footage," area DCP Pushpendra Kumar said.&nbsp;</p><p>"Soon, we will arrest the accused. There was not prompt action by the duty officer (DO). We are internally inquiring into the lapses and, if found guilty, we will take action against the DO and others."</p><p><b>Delay in action<br /></b></p><p>Cops are claiming that there was a hold up as the station house officer (SHO) was on leave and the junior staff did not brief seniors about the incident. Also, the PCR staff gave wrong information about the location, as "Burger Colony" that caused the&nbsp;delay in action.</p><p>"On Sunday night, I along with my wife and son went to The Burger Club located in Rajouri Garden for dinner. Three youths came inside the restaurant carrying a glass filled with alcohol and two of them went inside the washroom. My son urgently wanted to use the washroom so I knocked on the door several times, but they didn't open up," the surgeon said.</p><p>"When we came out of the washroom after a few minutes, one of the accused stopped me while the other put his hand on my shoulder. This was the trigger point," said the victim.&nbsp;</p><p>"I didn't even talk to them, but they were making lewd and suggestive gestures. Seeing all this, when my wife tried to protect me, one of the accused held her wrist and abused us. I pushed them to save my wife. Meanwhile, one of them molested her. Everything was captured on the CCTV camera."</p><p>When Mail Today spoke to the eatery's employees, they said the accused brought a glass full of alcohol along with them when they came inside the restaurant.</p><p>"Three youths entered the restaurant already with a glass. They didn't order anything. It seems they just wanted to use our toilet," restaurant manager Jitender said.</p><p>The doctor's wife said her son has been traumatised after witnessing his parents being beaten up.&nbsp;</p><p>"He saw blood on my face and kept crying the whole night. He has still not been able to come out of the trauma," she said.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/drunk-naval-officers-pavement-dweller-killed-vizag/1/680070.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/drunk-naval-officers-pavement-dweller-killed-vizag/1/680070.html">Also read: 3 drunk naval officers arrested after car runs over pavement dweller in Vizag</a></b> <br />&nbsp;<br /></p>]]></storybody>
