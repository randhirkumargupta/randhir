<storykicker><![CDATA[Six men from Delhi's Sonia Vihar left in an SUV, with two in the front seat and four in the back, for a drive to Haryana's Murthal area to have parathas. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Amit Singh (30) dropped his pregnant wife off at a railway station for her train to their hometown Ambedkar Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, promising that he will soon join her there. But before she could reach home, the family got the information that he, along with five others, died in a road accident. </p><p>Amit was accompanied by his uncle Vikas Singh (30), who recently came to Delhi from Ambedkar Nagar and was about to return home. Before going back, he wanted Amit to take him to famous paratha eating joints in Murthal.&nbsp;</p><p><b>ALL SIX PEOPLE DIED ON THE SPOT&nbsp;</b></p><p>Amit, along with his friends and business partner, planned to drive to Murthal early morning and left in his friend Deepak's car. </p><p>All six people in the car (between 25-37 years) died on the spot as their speeding EcoSport car rammed into a stationary heavy vehicle on National Highway 1 near Budhpur Village in Alipur around 4:30 am on Friday.&nbsp;</p><p>"Vikas came to Delhi for some work and was staying with Amit. He had requested Amit to take him to Murthal to eat paratha. Before going for a ride, Amit dropped his pregnant wife Gunjan to the railway station and said he will soon join&nbsp;her after finishing his work in Delhi. After dropping her, he planned a car ride to Murthal with his friends and they started the trip during the wee hours," one of the family members told MAIL TODAY.&nbsp;</p><p><b>RAMMED A STATIONARY HEAVY VEHICLE&nbsp;</b></p><p>Amit was a resident of Sonia Vihar and had a scrap business. He was also a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) and got married a year ago. His friend, Deepak Yadav, who was from Mahavir Enclave area and also had a scrap business, was driving the car while Amit's business associate Ansar Ahmed was sitting in the front seat. </p><p>They had barely travelled 15 kilometers from Sonia Vihar and were yet to cross the Delhi border when they failed to notice a stationary heavy vehicle and rammed it from behind.&nbsp;</p><p>"They failed to notice the truck which was stationary on the middle of the road as it got punctured. The driver of the car lost control over the wheels and hit it from behind. The car was at a very high speed when the accident took place. The impact of the accident was so high that debris of the car got thrown meters away. The entire bonnet and the front seat of the car got crushed due to the accident leaving air bags of no use," an eye witness said.&nbsp;</p><p><b>RESCUE TEAM HAD TO CUT OPEN THE DOORS&nbsp;</b></p><p>The vehicle lay there for nearly half an hour before someone informed the cops. The car was so badly damaged that the rescue team had to cut open the doors using a&nbsp;gas cutter to take out the bodies of the passengers.&nbsp;</p><p>The victims were rushed to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital but were declared brought dead. The deceased have been identified as Amit Singh (30), Vivekanand (26), Ansar Ahmed (33) resident of Sonia Vihar in East Delhi, Nishant (27) was from Loni in Ghaziabad and Vikas (30) from Ambedkar Nagar in Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp;</p><p>The driver of the car was identified as Deepak Yadav (35). The truck driver who had left the vehicle at the spot was detained a few hours later. He told police that he had come to Delhi to unload sand and was hurrying back to Karnal before the entry restrictions were put in place.&nbsp;</p><p>Police say that the truck didn't comply with the fitness standards mentioned in the MV rules&nbsp;</p><p>"The truck was parked wrongly. As it got punctured it should have been on the extreme left side of the carriage way but the driver had parked it on the extreme right side of the carriageway i.e towards the divider. No reflector or indicator was put in place leading to the accident," a&nbsp;senior officer said.&nbsp;</p><p>It was difficult to identify the victim as they faces were crushed but the police team found a mobile phone of one of the victims through which they were identified. Police contacted Deepak's family after checking his detail through his car's registration number.</p>]]></storybody>
