<storybody><![CDATA[<p>AN Intelligence Bureau (IB) report of 2011 shows that arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari was in regular touch with a cross-section of politicians, including Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra.</p><p>India Today accessed the report prepared in 2011 after Bhandari's name started surfacing in connection with the deal to purchase Basic Jet Trainers (BTAs) for the Indian Air Force. In February 2008, Sanjay Bhandari had set up Offsets India Solutions (OIS), ostensibly to benefit from the Defence Ministry's policy, enabling domestic industry to gain from the big-ticket arms contract spin-offs.</p><p><b>DE-CODING VADRA-BHANDARI CONNECTION </b><br /></p><p>The IB report concluded that OIS was only a front for Bhandari, who till then was better known in Delhi circles as a luxury car importer having influential clients, to lobby for defence deals. In 2010, Bhandari caught IB's eye as a lobbyist for Pilatus as the company allegedly engaged him to push the sale of 75 PC7 BTAs to IAF. IB went through Call Detail Records (CDRs) of Bhandari's number 9811144**5 for six months and found that Robert Vadra was among the people with whom the arms dealer was in regular touch.</p><p>The IB report said there were multiple calls made from Bhandari's mobile to a number (9810700**4) registered in the name of Robert Vadra's company Blue Bridge Trading Private Limited. Even at present, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs website shows Robert Vadra and his mother Maureen Vadra as the directors of Blue Bridge Trading. According to the IB report, in 2011, this number was being used by Robert Vadra. Blue Bridge Trading is the same company whose name cropped up in connection with the alleged Vadra land scam in Gurugram.</p><p><b>DEEP CONNECTIONS&nbsp; </b></p><p>Bhandari was also in touch with other Congress leaders. Prominent among them was Shreeprakash Jaiswal, coal minister during the UPA government. The report shows multiple calls between Bhandari and a landline number registered at the former minister's 7 Teen Murti Marg address. Bhandari also spoke frequently to then Congress leader S P Y Reddy, who at the time was an MP from Andhra Pradesh. These calls were made to Reddy's MTNL mobile number 9868180**2. </p><p>Apart from Congress leaders, Bhandari was also in regular touch with another close associated of Sonia Gandhi's constituency, Rae Bareilly. The IB's CDR report showed multiple calls to the director of the Rae Bareilly based Indira Gandhi Civil Aviation academy on his mobile number 9918857**7.</p><p>Congress' chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala told India Today, "An individual is being systematically prosecuted and hounded time and again, without an iota of evidence. Merely speaking to someone on the phone proves nothing. The BJP should stop this." BJP MP Kirit Somaiya hit out at the UPA for suppressing the IB report. "The defence deal lobbying and kickbacks had become part of the Congress culture. We want the investigative agencies to expose the truth," he said.</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/robert-vadra-sonia-gandhi-london-house-row/1/681471.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/robert-vadra-sonia-gandhi-london-house-row/1/681471.html">Also read: Modi a PM, not emperor, Vadra's London home probe a conspiracy: Sonia</a></b></p>]]></storybody>
