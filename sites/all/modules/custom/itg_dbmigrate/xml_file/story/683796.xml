<storybody><![CDATA[<p>At a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a 2-day visit to Qatar, Indian workers who are stranded in Doha have appealed to the government for help.</p><p>Although PM Modi visited some camps in Qatar where Indian workers reside, he wasn't taken to those camps where Indian, Nepalese workers reside in poor conditions.</p><p>India Today spoke to some of the distressed workers who are stranded in Doha. </p><p>These Indian workers worked with a construction company named EBID group which has now abandoned its operations in the country. There has been no response to the e-mails sent to the company's Qatar and Cairo offices by India Today in this regard.</p><p>India Today spoke to some of the workers who are now left without any money or work visa with them. There are about 150 workers of Indian origin who are stranded in Doha right now, a group of about hundred students are living in Al-Shahaniya whereas another group of about 50 workers are living in Sanaiya Industrial area. </p><p>"Conditions here are pathetic, we are forced to live in worst conditions without basic facilities, we neither have money nor licence to work here" said Md Sadiq, an Indian worker from Varanasi who has been working with EBID group since last two years. </p><p>"We did not get our salaries in the month of January, soon we came to know that the company had decided to wind up its operations in Qatar, we have no means to survive or return back to our motherland" Sadiq told India Today over phone.</p><p>"We contacted Indian embassy for help and were given assurance for the same but nothing has happened so far, we hope that this visit of PM Modi will result into a positive action and we will be able to return home during the month of Ramadan" said Anish Khan, another stranded Indian worker from Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh.  </p><p>"Even if the Indian government could help us in getting our work visa extended, we can earn enough money to arrange for our return" said Kanhaiya Lal, another Indian worker from Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu.</p><p>Ministry of External Affairs has taken note of India Today report and is trying to ascertain facts in this matter. <br /></p><p>                       {funfacts}<div class="conclace-story-wrapper"><div class="dotted-line"></div><div class="conclace-heading">DETAILS OF THE CASE</div>
