<storybody><![CDATA[<p>This is one "conspiracy theory" -- or is it really real -- that refuses to die. There have been allegations in the past that Facebook apps installed in the Android phones and iPhones can listen into the real-world conversations of users and then use that information to show relevant ads. Now again a report says that the Facebook app is actively listening to the sound and conversations around the phone and possibly using this information for targeted advertisements.</p><p>According to a report in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/31/facebook_is_listening/" mce_href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/31/facebook_is_listening/">Register</a> , Kelli Burns, a mass communication professor at the University of South Florida, recently found that the Facebook app on her phone was listening to her conversations.</p><p>"I'm really interested in going on an African safari. I think it'd be wonderful to ride in one of those jeeps," she reportedly said while holding her phone in hand.</p><p>"Under a minute later, the first story in her Facebook feed was about a safari. And a car ad soon appeared on her page," notes the Register report.</p><p>Earlier, Facebook had acknowledged that its app could occasionally listen to the sounds around a phone. It is a part of a feature rolled out in the US. The feature allows a users, while writing a status update, to let the app listen to the sound around the phone and then suggest topics to tag. For example, if a user is listening to a song on the home audio system and he opens to app to update the status, the app may identify the song and auto-suggest the name of the song that can be included in the status update.</p><p>"Here's how it works: If you've turned the feature on, you'll see an audio icon moving on the screen when you write a status update. If the feature finds a match, you can then choose to add the song, TV show or movie to your post," Aryeh Selekman, a Facebook product manager, <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/05/a-new-optional-way-to-share-and-discover-music-tv-and-movies/">wrote in 2014.</a> </p><p>However, Facebook says that the feature is optional and it is not used to collect any conversations or audio. The information identified through the feature is also not used for advertisements purposes. "Facebook does not use microphone audio to inform advertising in any way. Businesses are able to serve relevant ads to people based on other aspects, such as their age, their city and their interests," a Facebook spokesperson told IndiaToday.In.</p><p>Facebook also says that the feature, which identifies sounds, is only triggered if a user is writing a Facebook post.</p><p>However, the information discovered by professor Burns is different. Although her experience also seems to be anecdotal, similar to what many people have <a target="_blank" href="https://np.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3nxjwt/discussion_facebook_listening_to_conversations/">narrated on Reddit</a>  in the last one year, and she hasn't provided any conclusive proof that Facebook listened in to her conversations.</p><p>With the voice command and contextual awareness now big part of user interface, apps and the devices that are "always listening" are getting increasingly common. Devices like Amazon's Echo, which is a sort of virtual home assistant, always listens to sounds around it to make sense of the context. Similarly, Android phones have the always listening mode on by default. This is why you can say "OK Google" to an Android phone and search something instantly on it without having to touch even single key. Similarly on the iPhone, Siri is always in the "listening mode".</p><p>At the same time, the "always listening modes" have also brought to the fore privacy concerns. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and others have tried to address the privacy concerns. However, the incident related to Professor Burns shows, not everyone is convinced.</p><p class="review_also_read"><strong>Also read: </strong> <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/facebook-knows-what-you-are-thinking-of-buying-here-is-how/1/571318.html
