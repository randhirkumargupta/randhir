<storykicker><![CDATA[Uma Bharti ruled herself out as a possible chief ministerial candidate for Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Once the fiery mascot of the Ram temple movement, Union Minister Uma Bharti wants a resolution to the lingering dispute through dialogue even as she hails controversial BJP MP Subramanian Swamy as her "hero", saying she believes his words that work on the temple in Ayodhya will start by the end of this year.</p><p><b>CONFIDENCE IN BJP</b></p><p>Bharti ruled herself out as a possible chief ministerial candidate for Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, but voiced confidence that BJP will be able to form its government in the key Hindi heartland state with Amit Shah at the helm of the party.<br /><b><br />SWAMY IS MY HERO</b></p><p>On the issue of Ram temple construction and Swamy's remarks that the work on it will start this year, Bharti said, "I respect Swamy very much. He is my hero. I was 15-16 years old when Emergency was imposed and Dr Swamy, George Fernandes were my heroes. For me he is a heroic figure. So whatever he says, I will believe that." </p><p>The remarks by BJP's yesteryear Hindutva mascot comes at a time when the party leadership is skirting questions on Ram temple and repeatedly insisting that development will be the party's poll plank in UP as it seeks to wrest the politically important state from Samajwadi Party.<br /><b><br />LAND DISPUTE<br /></b><br />Speaking at an event in Mumbai in April, Swamy had claimed that work to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya would begin by this year-end. He had expressed confidence that next year Hindus would celebrate Ram Navami at the Ram temple.</p><p>"The issue in the Ram temple movement was whether it was the birthplace of Lord Rama or not. The three-judge bench of Allahabad HC said one thing undisputedly that the dome in the middle is of Ramlala. The Ram temple movement got legal sanction with that declaration.</p><p>"Now the dispute that remains is the dispute of land. There is no dispute now on whether it is Ram Janmabhoomi or not. Movements are not needed to resolve land disputes. It has to be resolved either through a dialogue or a legislation. I feel that the most beautiful solution to Ram janmabhoomi issue can be found through dialogue," she said. <br /></p><p>Bharti suggested that parties to the dispute should sit together and saints and religious leaders of both sides facilitate dialogue between the two communities and tell the court they have resolved the issue.</p><p>"And a magnificent temple is built there. I am very proud that I took part in the movement, which has also got the stamp of the court that I was right," she said, referring to the Allahabad High Court judgement.<br /></p>]]></storybody>
