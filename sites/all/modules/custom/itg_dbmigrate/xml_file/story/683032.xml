<storybody><![CDATA[<p>BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav is being credited for his party's splendid performance in Assam and also in Jammu and Kashmir. It was Madhav who succeeded in forging an alliance between the BJP and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir. </p><p>However, the former member of the National Executive of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) believes that election victories are a result of cumulative effort and not because of an individual. &nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to Karan Thapar on his show To The Point, Madhav, who was deputed to the BJP from RSS in August 2014, said he continues to be a pracharak.</p><p>"I have been loaned to the BJP. It is quite flattering to see people calling me an architect of party's win but I know the truth. No electoral victory is possible because of one individual. We've had many things at&nbsp; time, at time place to achieve success," Madhav, who planned PM Modi's much talked about Madison Square and Sydney diaspora meets, said.</p><p><b>HERE'S WHAT MADHAV SAID</b></p><p><b>ON CONGRESS</b></p><p>- If there is one message which has come out of recent election results then it is this that people have rejected the Congress completely.</p><p>- Look at Assam, Kerala, they were rejected. In Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, those who tried to become their bedfellows actually became the victim of the alliance.</p><p>- If the Congress still refuses to take the message and want to justify their defeat by saying they got more seats that the BJP, let them be happy.</p><p>- You can compare 2014 elections with that in 2009. 2016 has to be compared only with 2011. Parliament elections are fought on totally different issues. State elections are fought on different issues... combinations change.</p><p><b>ON UTTARAKHAND</b></p><p>- What we did in Uttarakhand was based on the given situation at that time.</p><p>- Looking back, one may feel that probably whatever happened should not have happened at that time although you had a right to do that.</p><p>- Whatever we did was right.</p><p><b>ON JNU CONTROVERSY</b></p><p>- Kanhaiya Kumar has become a big icon for the Congress&nbsp; and its supporters.</p><p>- I'll tell you one interesting thing, in Assam, we found more posters and hoardings of Kanhaiya Kumar than Rahul Gandhi himself.</p><p>- Most of the people in this country believe that the kind of politics that people like Kanhaiya Kumar practice is not in the national interest and also not in the interest of campus students.</p><p><b>ON BHARAT MATA KI JAI ROW</b></p><p>- India, in our Constitution in Article 1, is described as Bharat. When you say Bharat Mata Ki Jai, you are hailing your country.</p><p>- Why should one have objection to this?</p><p>- I believe that every citizen of the country should at least respect the slogan. They may choose not to utter it morning, day and night which is fair enough.</p><p>- Why should a Member of Parliament or a prominent leader say 'I will never say Bharat Mata Ki Jai'?</p><p>- We should not create unwanted controversies.</p><p><b>INTOLERANCE ROW CREATED BY OPPOSITION</b></p><p>- We are not creating controversies, it is being created by our opponents.</p><p>- This government is only focusing on good governance.</p><p>- Results of various surveys show that 70 per cent people are happy with the Modi government.</p><p><b>MODI GOVT WILL DELIVER WHAT IT PROMISED</b></p><p>- At a time when the entire global economy is in tatters, we have a government which has been able to maintain 7.9 per cent growth rate.</p><p>- The world has acknowledged that India has the most stable economy today. The government must be credited for it.</p><p>- People are happy but there are some commentators who keep on harping that negative things.</p><p>- We have only completed 2 years, we have been elected for 5 years...reforms are on their way. But you must understand that we have a great obstructionist party as Opposition.</p><p>- This government will not bulldoze anything. We will take every stakeholder into confidence before bringing in the reforms. Those reforms will be good for the industry, farmers, investors and nation.</p><p><b>ALSO READ</b>:&nbsp; <b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bjp-makes-history-in-assam-mahendra-singh-plots-partys-win/1/674336.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bjp-makes-history-in-assam-mahendra-singh-plots-partys-win/1/674336.html"></a></b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bjp-makes-history-in-assam-mahendra-singh-plots-partys-win/1/674336.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bjp-makes-history-in-assam-mahendra-singh-plots-partys-win/1/674336.html">BJP makes history in Assam, Mahendra Singh plots party's win</a></b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mehbooba-mufti-bjp-congress/1/679932.html" target="_blank">Mehbooba Mufti defends alliance with BJP, hits out at Congress</a></b>  <br /></p>]]></storybody>
