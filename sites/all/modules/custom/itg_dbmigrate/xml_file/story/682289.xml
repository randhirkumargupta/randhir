<storykicker><![CDATA[NIA is in process of giving final touch to its two crucial chargesheets in ISIS case.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A tale of two Islamic State or ISIS recruits, two separate chargesheets, their lives entwined by a WhatsApp group. And now a common fate: a life behind bars.</p><p>NIA investigators are in process of giving a final touch to its two crucial chargesheets in the ISIS case. Both chargesheets will be filed this week, one in Jaipur and other in Delhi.</p><p><b>HERE IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p><b>1.</b> The first case is against Mohammad Sirajuddin (33), a marketing manager with the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) posted in Jaipur, who was arrested last December, for his alleged links to the Islamic State. He wanted to travel to Syria with his newborn son and train him to become a Jihadi. Sirajuddin was arrested by Rajasthan ATS in January this year.</p><p><b>2.</b> A brilliant student, who not only got a scholarship for his education as an engineer, Sirajudeen got a campus placement in IOC, Bangalore but was finally posted to Jaipur, from where he was arrested. His online activites were being monitored. Deeply radicalized, he was in the process of making plans to fly to Syria without being detected. But his plan was nipped in the bud.</p><p><b>3.</b> The second is the case Mohammed Naseer (23), a computer engineer from Tamil Nadu who was working in the UAE. So radicalized was he that he flew to Sudan in a bid to reach Libya, from where he attempted to reach his final destination, Syria.</p><p><b>4.</b> His father Mohammed Pakeer and a terminally-ill cancer patient Yusha Kashmiri have made statements against the young ISIS terror recruit. His online activity is also being used a digital evidence in the ISIS case.</p><p><b>{mosimage}5.</b> Sirajuddin and Naseer, otherwise unknown to each other, were part of the same WhatsApp group known as the 'Umma Affairs'. The group, administered by a Filipino woman named Karen Aisha Hamidon and a Kenyan woman Ameena, had a deep influence on them.</p><p><b>6.</b> The common link to both the accused in the ISIS case is not just the two women, but also the WhatsApp group. The group had soon swelled to about 100 members, but there were differences of opinion, so another group was created by the name of 'BUG' on Telegram.</p><p><b>7.</b> Radicalized and ambitious to join the ISIS, Naseer shared his plans with the group unknowingly influencing a married and well-settled Sirajuddin to make plans too. Naseer's plans were nipped in the bud, with him getting arrested and finally being deported from Sudan in December 2015. </p><p><b>{mosimage}8.</b> Sirajuddin, meanwhile, got deeply involved with Ameena, chatting for several hours and wished to marry her. She later turned out to be a housemaid from Kenya who was working in Hyderabad. She was deported back.</p><p><b>9.</b> Sirajuddin and Ameena were also part of a WhatsApp group run by a woman ring leader, Karen from the Philippines. The digital trail is an important evidence in both cases, besides witness statements, who only corroborate what the investigators have claimed.</p><p><b>10.</b> While the chargesheet against Sirajuddin will be filed in Jaipur NIA court, the one against Naseer will be filed in Delhi's NIA court in Patiala House. Both are expected to be filed between the June 4-6. They now await the same fate, a life behind bars for being ISIS terror recruits.</p>]]></storybody>
