<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday questioned the authenticity of the fresh report which stated that the meat found at the spot, where Dadri resident Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched, was of "cow or its progeny". </p><p>"Where was the sample sent, who received it? There was nothing objectionable in his house. Every eye is on this matter. Everyone wants that the victim's family should get justice as murder had taken place. After this incident, there was debate in the world regarding what to eat and speak. I think one should not get involved in such matters," Yadav told reporters in Ambedkar Nagar district.</p><p><b>KEEP AWAY FROM CONTROVERSIES</b></p><p>"One should not be concerned about what a person eats or drinks and which language he or she uses. I think one should keep away from such controversies," Akhilesh advised.</p><p>His remarks came after a report prepared by a forensic lab in Mathura concluded that the meat found was beef. The finding was in contrast to the preliminary report of an inquiry by the Uttar Pradesh veterinary department which said the meat over which Mohammad Akhlaq, 52, was lynched on September 28 last in Dadri was mutton of "goat progeny".</p><p>However, BJP MP Adityanath said the report has put UP government, opposition parties at the Centre and a section of media in the dock. "They are mum on this report. The innocent Hindus arrested in the matter should immediately be released and a case of cow slaughter should be registered against Akhlaq's family," he said in Gorakhpur. "I also demand that the state government should withdraw all facilities given to his (Akhlaq's) family," he said.</p><p>The report by the Forensic laboratory of the Uttar Pradesh University of Veterinary Services(Animal Husbandry) examined the sample of meat recovered from the spot in Dadri. It was stated that on the basis of chemical analysis the forensic investigation of the sample showed that it belonged to cow or its progeny. The report was sent to the Noida police and submitted to a fast-track court in a sealed cover, an official said.<br /></p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-the-meat-in-victims-house-was-beef-says-forensic-report/1/682162.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-the-meat-in-victims-house-was-beef-says-forensic-report/1/682162.html">Also read: Dadri lynching: The meat in victim's house was beef, says forensic report</a></b></p>]]></storybody>
