<storykicker><![CDATA[ Family members of some other arrested youths could be seen discussing 
the future strategy. "We will hold a panchayat on Wednesday to plan our 
future course of action. The villagers will seek action against Iqlakh's
 family," said Dheeraj Singh, whose two sons, both in 20's, were

<storybody><![CDATA[<p>When you ask for directions in Bisada, a villager volunteers to help. "All victims' families live in this lane," he says. The idea of victim for Hindus who live in Dadri, where Mohammed Iqlakh was lynched to death is different. </p><p>By victims, they mean the 18 young men who are in jail on charges of murder since September last year. For them Iqlakh's family is the accused and should be put behind bars for cow slaughter. The change in mood came after the Mathura forensic laboratory concluded that the meat stored in Iqlakh's house was beef. <br /><b><br />Politics over beef</b></p><p>The report has the potential to change the political atmosphere in western Uttar Pradesh. This assumes greater significance in wake of the Assembly elections scheduled for early next year. Apparently miffed over the 'intolerance debate' triggered by Iqlakh's death, villagers termed the subsequent police action a 'conspiracy' and demanded a CBI probe into the episode.</p><p> "We will go to any extent to get justice. Our children have been implicated in the case on serious charge of murder," said Sanjay Rana, a villager whose 22-year old son, Vishal, has been in jail for the last eight months. While Vishal's ailing grandfather lies on the bed, women of the house curiously hear the conversation anticipating some news of their son.</p><p>"It has all changed. Till now his (Iqlakh's) family was the victim. But now we feel like the victims. Let the law take its course. The entire family of Iqlakh should be put behind bars. Either the UP government should withdraw the law on cow slaughter or we will not tolerate cow slaughterers," Rana said as he looked at the photograph of Vishal.</p><p>At 10.30pm, family members of some other arrested youths could be seen discussing the future strategy. "We will hold a panchayat on Wednesday to plan our future course of action. The villagers will seek action against Iqlakh's family," said Dheeraj Singh, whose two sons, both in 20's, were arrested in the case. As the conversation goes on, another villager Rajpal Singh chipped in saying the cow was slaughtered in Iqlakh's house.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, a report prepared by a forensic lab in Mathura concluded that the meat found in the victim's house was beef. The finding was in contrast to the preliminary report of an enquiry by the Uttar Pradesh Veterinary department which said the meat was mutton. "What was recovered from the house of Iqlakh in Dadri was beef," a senior prosecution officer in the case said.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-beef-in-refrigerator-mohammad-akhlaq/1/681694.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-beef-in-refrigerator-mohammad-akhlaq/1/681694.html">Also read: Dadri lynching: Fresh forensic report says meat in Akhlaq's freezer was beef, not mutton</a></b></p>]]></storybody>
