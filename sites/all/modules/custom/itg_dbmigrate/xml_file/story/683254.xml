<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Hyderabad is decked up like never before and all ten districts of Telangana are in a celebratory spirit on the occasion of second anniversary of the formation of the state. </p><p><b>RESPECT TO THE MARTYRS</b> <br /></p><p>Just as he did two years ago before he was sworn in as chief minister, K Chandrasekhara Rao (KCR) began the day by paying homage at the Telangana Martyrs Memorial, built as a tribute to those who gave up their lives during the first separate statehood agitation of 1969- 70. </p><p>Next, he laid the foundation for a new Telangana martyrs memorial near the Lumbini Park, skirting the Hussain Sagar in the heart of the city, to respect those who died in the agitation demanding statehood spearheaded by his TRS party since its inception in 2000.</p><p><b>LARGEST TRICOLOR EVER</b> <br /></p><p>After satiating the spirits of the statehood campaigners, the Telangana chief minister unfurled the largest ever national tricolor to be hoisted in the country at the Sanjivayya Park, on the northern fringes of Hussain Sagar. </p><p>The flag is 108 feet by 72 feet and positioned to be a part of Telangana's heritage. Originally, it was to be both the largest as well as the tallest tricolor flying atop the tallest mast, 303 feet long, to be bigger than the 70 feet by 105 feet flag, fluttering in contiguous Chattisgarh's capital, Raipur, and higher than the one on a 293 feet long mast in Jharkand's Ranchi. The flag in Ranchi was unveiled only in January this year.</p><p>To the chagrin of KCR, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Director General of Civil Aviation put paid to his grand plan to have the massive flag flutter on the tallest mast. Now, mandarins of the state's Road and Buildings department tasked for the Rs. 1. 96 crore project are wary of disclosing the actual height of the mast as they failed to accomplish KCR's goal. </p><p><b>ENGINEERING MARVEL</b> <br /></p><p>Engineers involved in the work claim that it is 300 feet from the ground to suggest the state has not lost out much in gaining pride of place as the initial plan was for a 303 feet long mast. The authorities have four more flags in store to replace the one fluttering tall and high if it is soiled or damaged. And the plan is to bring it down the 100 tonne pole just once a month for inspection.</p><p>Significantly, it only after these three stops, setting out from home, that KCR drove to the Parade Grounds in Secunderabad to review contingents from different police and other state security units march past and declare that he reaffirms his faith in the pledges and promises made by the TRS before it assumed power and his government is focused sharply on achieving the ambitious goal of creating a 'Bangaru Telangana.'</p><p><b>Also read:</b></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/telangana-to-celebrate-2nd-statehood-day-today/1/683186.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/telangana-to-celebrate-2nd-statehood-day-today/1/683186.html">Telangana turns two, PM Modi wishes state progress </a> <br /></p>]]></storybody>
