<storykicker><![CDATA[The story of Japan's Yamato Tanooka may remind you a little of The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen. Here's how the 7-year-old survived six days in the woods all by himself, after his parents abandoned him on a mountain road. ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>You must have come across Yamato Tanooka's story by now - the 7-year-old boy who was found six days after going missing in Japan's bear-inhabited woods after his parents abandoned him as punishment.</p><p>Apart from the bizarre punishment, Yamato's story may not seem unusual. Every day, scores of children go missing in India alone. &nbsp;</p><p>But how often do you hear of a child, left to spend six days in the wilderness by himself, coming out of it "calm" and composed?</p><p>Yamato Tanooka is one of that kind.</p><p><br /></p><h3>The Genki from Japan</h3><p>When military personnel accidentally discovered Yamato in an abandoned wooden hut, the boy did not shed a single tear. Instead, he asked for food. </p><p>The soldiers gave him two rice balls and some bread, which he gobbled up hungrily. He looked a bit worn out, but apart from that, he was "genki"; the Japanese word for 'healthy children'.</p><p>From the moment his parents left him on a mountain road last Saturday to early morning today, Yamato fended for himself. Unless there was some mother ghost who had his back, like in the movie Mamma, the only thing that kept him alive was his resourcefulness and resilience.</p><p>It is understood that he walked several kilometres before finding the empty hut in the military drill area. This path also involved a rigorous uphill climb.</p><p>Equipped with some mattresses, one unlocked door and no power, this hut became Yamato's safe house.</p><p>Yamato quenched his thirst from a lone tap situated outside the hut. At night, when the temperature dropped to as low as 7 degree Celcius and the hut became pitch dark, he huddled between the mattresses on the floor and slept.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Survived with nothing but mild scratches</h3><p>The doctors said that apart from dehydration and minor cuts on his arms and feet, Yamato showed no serious health issues.</p><p>While details of his experience are not clear, it is believed he mostly starved during this period, surviving solely on tap water. Though people can survive for some time without food, experts say a water-only diet can be painful.</p><p>Also, when rescued, the doctor who him said "he didn't panic at all": "He was incredibly calm considering he had been missing for seven days." </p><p>Whether this calm demeanour was a reaction to the trauma he experienced is still not clear. But it is probably safe to say that Yamato is simply one brave boy.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Japan praises their young hero</h3><p>The nation welcomed the boy back into the safety of human habitation with much rejoicing.&nbsp; Old photos of Yamato - wearing a cowboy hat, holding up two fingers in a peace sign, his bangs falling over a proud smile - were flashed across TV.</p><p>Daijiro Hashimoto, a former governor, appeared on a talk show on TV Asahi and wondered how the boy had endured the loneliness, especially at night, and suggested that perhaps he had imagined he was on some adventure and was hiding in a secret camp.</p><p>"He had to keep a very positive attitude," Hashimoto said. "He is fantastic. He didn't know how long it might take, and when he would ever be saved."</p><p><br /></p><h3>The Parent Trap</h3><p>The celebrations apart, Yamato's disappearance has made the nation sit up and acknowledge how children are raised and disciplined here.</p><p>The parents' decision to teach their 7-year-old a lesson by abandoning him near a bear-residing forest has triggered a massive debate on parenting ethics. </p><p>Japanese culture is not seen as promoting individual rights of children, but rather to view children almost as family property. Abandonment and child abuse are far more common in Japan than the stereotype of the doting parent and stay-at-home mom would suggest.</p><p>Keeping the issue of unfair laws aside, can an ageing nation with a dearth of children afford this?</p><p>While Yamato's parents welcomed him back with tears and apology, it needs to be noted that they will officially not be under any police investigation for the way they treated their son.</p>]]></storybody>
