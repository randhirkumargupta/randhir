list of non-mammal, and plant-based types of milk that you might want to

<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Celebrating World Milk Day today, we wondered how or actually what led humans to jump to the conclusion that drinking cow's milk is the best way to get protein and vitamin D in the body. </p><p>According to www.phys.org, "Milk drinking started around 7,500 years ago in central Europe and the genetic change that enabled early Europeans to drink milk without getting sick has been mapped to dairying farmers."</p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/soy-milk-soya-milk-soybeans-benefits-over-cows-milk-vegetable-protein-dariy-milk-good-for-weight-loss/1/543142.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/soy-milk-soya-milk-soybeans-benefits-over-cows-milk-vegetable-protein-dariy-milk-good-for-weight-loss/1/543142.html"><b>Also read: All that you need to know about soy milk: It's better than drinking cow's milk and is great for weight-loss </b></a> <br /></p><p>Now that the time frame has been established, we're still clueless about the exact reason as to what made humans stick to just cows as a source of milk. Over a period of time, researchers and scientists have developed better and far too many varieties of milk that carry double (or at least equal amounts of) the health benefits of cow's milk.</p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/milk-is-natures-best-wellness-drink-4-healthy-reasons-slurp/1/531748.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/milk-is-natures-best-wellness-drink-4-healthy-reasons-slurp/1/531748.html"><b>Also read: Milk is nature's best wellness drink, here are 4 healthy reasons for you to slurp it</b></a> <br /></p><p><b>Here are some non-cow milk alternatives you may want to try to understand what suits your body and taste buds!</b></p><p><b>Camel milk:</b> Known to be a high source of Vitamin C, camel milk is low in fat and is more digestible than cow's milk. The best part about this type of milk is that it's suitable for the lactose-intolerant and is normally consumed raw or in fermented form. </p><p>Kim Kardashian West tried it last year on a trip to Bahrain and posted about it on her Instagram account. This generated a huge demand for the milk and it has now become a rage with many celebs. <br /></p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div class="mceVisualAid" style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/SseDikOS5y/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">Got Camels Milk???</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2012-12-01T13:01:20+00:00">Dec 1, 2012 at 5:01am PST</time></p></div></blockquote>

Plus, the calorie and saturated fat content is higher in this type of milk. <br /></p><p><b>Pig milk: </b>It is an excellent source of nutrients, however, it contains about 8.5 per cent of fat compared to cow's milk which is a mere 3.9 per cent. </p><p><b>Goat milk:</b> A milk type that is great for digestion, goat's milk is also a metabolism booster. However, it is not meant for people who are lactose intolerant.</p><p><b>Reindeer milk: </b>This milk is known to be lactose free, but is extremely high in fat.</p><p><b>Sheep milk:</b> High in calories, sheep milk is great for making cheese and yogurt. It also contains twice the fat that cow's milk does. </p><p><b>Horse and donkey milk:</b> The two have almost similar compositions and are in fact, known to be the closest to human milk. In addition to that, donkey's milk has a protein profile that may make it more suitable for those allergic to cow's milk.</p><p><b>Yak milk: </b>This type of milk has a sweet smell and has a higher content of fat and protein than other types of milk. </p><p><b>Giraffe milk:</b> Giraffe milk is rich in vitamin A & B12 and is said to treat diabetes, cholesterol and irritable bowel syndrome. <br /></p><p><b>Plant-based milk alternatives too are high in nutrients but may not share the same nutritional values as that of cow's milk.
