<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Curious to know where your favourite Bollywood stars reside? Here, a 
glimpse into the abodes of 15 celebrities along with some interesting 
titbits.</p><p>***</p><p> <b>1. Aamir Khan<br /></b>The actor's home is no
 less perfect than the perfectionist himself. He stays with wife Kiran 
and son Azad in the 5,000 sq feet apartment in Bella Vista Apartments in
 Bandra--the decor of which feature a mix of modern Asian and European 
elements.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>He also has a 100-year-old bungalow in Panchgani that he bought from director Homi Adjania. </p><p><b>2. Rajesh Khanna<br /></b>This
 beautiful bungalow, situated on Mumbai's Carter road has been a 
pilgrimage for Rajesh Khanna's fans for decades. Of late, however, it 
has been shrouded in controversy as Anita Advani--Khanna's live-in 
partner--claimed rights to the bungalow, which has an estimated worth of
 over 100 crores.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>The house originally belonged 
to Bollywood legend Rajender Kumar who bought it in just Rs 60,000 as it
 was deemed to be haunted then.</p><p>After Khanna's death in 2012, his 
estranged wife Dimple Kapadia along with her daughters sold the house in
 about Rs 90 crores to a business. As of now, the bungalow is under 
construction.&nbsp; </p><p><b>3. Ahskay Kumar<br /></b>The Khiladi's 
beach-facing villa has quite the history to it. Rumour has it that a 
young Akshay Kumar was shooed away from the property about two decades 
ago when he was getting his portfolio shot with the bungalow as a 
backdrop.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>After he found success, Kumar bought 
the bungalow and renovated it to meet his family's requirements. He 
lives there with his wife, kids, mother and sister.&nbsp; </p><p><b>4. Anil Kapoor<br /></b>The
 acclaimed actor's Juhu bungalow is said to be the perfect mix of 
opulence and comfort. He lives there with his wife Sunita--an interior 
designer--as well as his daughters Sonam and Rhea, and son Harshvardhan.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>The Kapoors' bungalow also boasts of impressive lawns, and a fully-equipped gym. </p><p><b>5. Farhan Akhtar<br /></b>{mosimage}<br />The
 actor-director's sprawling bungalow, Vipassana, is spread across 10,000
 sq feet in Bandra. Akhtar bought the property--which close to his 
mother Honey Irani's residence--in 2009. </p><p><b>6. Salman Khan<br /></b>The
 eternal bachelor is actually quite the family man. He has been living 
in Galaxy Apartments since the last four decades with his extended 
family.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>Salman has been quoted as saying that 
though he is deeply attached to the one room set he occupies in the 
apartment, he finds it difficult to accommodate his ever-increasing 
baggage of clothes and accessories. And so he plans to move out with his
 family to a bigger space.</p><p><b>7. Hema Malini<br />{mosimage}<br /></b>The
 Dream Girl's bungalow in Juhu is a lovely green patch in the heart of 
city, and it has been designed by the creative honchos of ZZ Architects.
 She also owns a beautiful house in Goregaon.</p><p><b>8. Ranbir Kapoor<br />{mosimage}<br /></b>The
 heart-throb owns multiple homes in Mumbai, though he is known to mostly
 reside in his ancestral home--Krishna Raj--with his parents Rishi 
Kapoor and Neetu Singh.&nbsp; </p><p><b>9. Shah Rukh Khan<br /></b>King Khan's 
home Mannat is a paradise of luxury. SRK bought the heritage site from a
 trust and renovated it to include every modern amenity you can imagine.<br />{mosimage}<br />It
 has a huge library, a gym, a swimming pool, a mini theatre, and a 
basement parking that can house several cars. Additonally, it also has a
 bar and a sports room, besides lounges to entertain guests. </p><p><b>10. Amitabh Bachchan</b><br />The
 Bachchans' original sprawling mansion Prateeksha is known for its lush 
green lawns. ''Not much changes about this home in all these years, 
though everything has changed outside it (sic)," says Big B about 
Prateeksha in his blog.<br />{mosimage}<br />Big B and his family--including
 son Abhishek and daughter-in-law Aishwarya--live in their other home, 
Jalsa which is also located in Juhu.</p><p><b>11. Rekha<br /></b>Her 
Bandra home is protected by massive bamboo walls that make it almost 
impossible for a bystander to catch a glimpse of what's happening 
inside.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>Rekha's balcony overlooks the lawns of 
Farhan Akhtar's childhood home, and the actor-director claims that the 
actress used to click the pictures of his playmates from the spot to 
send them across later.</p><p><b>12. Saif Ali Khan<br />{mosimage}<br /></b>Chotte
 Nawab resides with wife Kareena Kapoor in Fortune Heights in Bandra. He
 also owns Ibrahim Kothi (Pataudi Palace in Gujarat) and several other 
properties in Bhopal.</p><p><b>13. Sanjay Dutt<br />{mosimage}<br /></b>Sanjay and Manyata Dutt stay in the ground floor apartment of Imperial Heights in Pali Hills.</p><p><b>14. Sonakshi Sinha<br />{mosimage}<br /></b>Daddy's little girl, Sonakshi resides with her parents and brothers in their bungalow Ramayan in Juhu. </p><p><b>15. Arjun Kapoor<br />{mosimage}<br /></b>There
 is nothing ''bachelor type'' about Arjun Kapoor's bachelor pad. It's a 
tastefully done flat replete with all modern amenities, including 
paintings collected by his (late) mother Mona Kapoor.</p>]]></storybody>
