<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A teenager, who turned 18 just four days after he allegedly hit and killed a Delhi-based marketing executive while driving his father's car, will be the first person to be prosecuted under India's amended Juvenile Justice Act.</p><p>While delivering the order, the juvenile justice board in the Capital quoted the report of a clinical psychologist that indicated the accused was less concerned about the impact of the accident upon the victim's family and much more about the outcome of the case.</p><p><b>LANDMARK ORDER<br /></b><br />"The accused was indifferent towards life and the safety of others on the road but was mature enough to think of ways to escape from lawful punishment from the offence," according to the mental health expert.</p><p>The board has sole authority to deal with matters concerning children in conflict with law.</p><p>The teenager ran over 32-year-old Siddharth Sharma with a Mercedes at north Delhi's Civil Lines area on April 4.</p><p>The landmark order comes after Parliament passed legislation in December lowering to 16 the age at which someone can be tried for serious crimes, spurred into action by uproar over the release of a minor convicted in a 2012 fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in the Capital.</p><p>The board said the investigating officer had rightly booked the accused for culpable homicide not amounting to murder as it seemed that the juvenile was driving not merely rashly or negligently but also knew well that it could lead to a serious accident.</p><p>"The likelihood of a fatal accident due to dangerous driving could not be considered to be beyond the imagination of the juvenile," the order said.</p><p>The board observed that the offence allegedly committed by him was "heinous'', which under the Act refers to an offence allegedly committed by a child who has completed, or is above, 16 years of age.</p><p><b>'HE WAS AWARE'</b></p><p>It also found that the accused in no manner lacked the mental and physical capacity to commit the offence. "He was in the habit of driving the car since long before the date of the incident, that too, without holding a driver's license," the board said. </p><p>"He had been already fined thrice for traffic rule violation before the present incident. The juvenile drove fast and dangerously despite the warnings by his friends. He did not stop after causing the accident. Rather, fled from the spot to avoid getting caught for his misdeed."</p><p>Arvind Nayar, the victim's counsel, said the board observed the conduct of the juvenile before and after the incident clearly reflect that he understood the consequences of the alleged crime.</p><p>The police told the court that the father of the juvenile attempted to mislead cops twice by twisting facts and by presenting their driver as the offender.</p><p><b>JUSTICE SERVED </b></p><p>Cops said the car was being driven at a speed of at least 80 km per hour and the victim was flung several feet into the air and landed about 15 metres away.</p><p>For the family of Siddharth, who would have turned 33 on Sunday, the order came as big relief. "The police tried to mislead us. There was no activity on the part of the cops. After several protests and approaching the commissioner of police, there was some impact," said Shilpa Mittal, the deceased's sister.</p><p>Her husband, Yogesh, said people only came forward to help after security camera footage of the accident went viral.</p><p>"Had we not been educated enough or lacked the ability to understand the system, we would have lost the battle," he said. "Nobody came to our support. We were not allowed to meet the L-G and Delhi chief minister."</p><p>Siddharth Sharma was also studying at Stratford University in Delhi and was preparing to go abroad.</p><p>"My brother wanted hi-tech speakers and that is what we had planned to give him for his birthday," said Shilpa. "We are yet to come to terms with the fact that he will never get to see that gift."</p><p><b>ALSO READ:</b><br /><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/delhi-mercedes-hit-and-run-juvenile-justice-board/1/678303.html ">Delhi Mercedes hit-and-run: Accused juvenile may be tried as an adult </a></b> </p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
