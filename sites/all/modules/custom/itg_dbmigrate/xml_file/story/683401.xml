<storybody><![CDATA[<p>England defender Chris Smalling headed the only goal with five minutes left as they beat 10-man Portugal 1-0 in a turgid Euro 2016 warm-up match at Wembley on Thursday. (<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/section/399/1/euro-2016.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/section/399/1/euro-2016.html"><b>Full Euro 2016 Coverage</b></a>)</p><p>The Manchester United centre half nodded the ball home from substitute Raheem Sterling's left-wing cross after the visitors failed to adequately clear a free kick by Kyle Walker.</p><p>The game offered precious little entertainment and even less goalmouth incident until Smalling struck.</p><p>Portugal, who rested talismanic striker Cristiano Ronaldo, had centre half Bruno Alves sent off for a reckless aerial challenge on Harry Kane in the 35th minute.</p><p>"It's never easy to play against 10 men," manager Roy Hodgson told ITV Sport after England collected their third friendly victory in 12 days.</p><p>"I thought in the second half we played some very good football and I thought especially in the last 30 minutes, after we made changes and brought on some fresh legs, that we looked good."</p><p>The crowd, which included newly-appointed Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, had to wait until the 23rd minute for the first effort on goal, a tame header from England captain Wayne Rooney easily saved by Rui Patricio.</p><p>Twelve minutes later Alves received a straight red card after catching Kane with a dangerous blow on the side of the head from his flying boot.</p><p><b>SET PIECES</b></p><p>There was no sign England were playing with a one-man advantage as Portugal completely dominated possession at the start of the second half.</p><p>Equally frustrating for the home fans was the sight of chief goal threat Kane taking the corners and set pieces until he was substituted in the 78th minute.</p><p>"Our composure throughout the game was good," added Hodgson as he accentuated the positives. "As a preparatory game it would have been better if we had played against 10 men but I'm pleased we kept a clean sheet and never looked like conceding a goal."</p><p>Portugal defender Jose Fonte said his team would benefit from their Wembley outing.</p><p>"We are disappointed obviously but we will come out of this stronger," said the Southampton centre half. "I thought we were compact and defended well.</p><p>"They didn't create many chances in the second half and we actually had two good chances to nick a goal."</p><p>England have been drawn in Euro 2016 Group B along with Wales, Russia and Slovakia while Portugal will meet Iceland, Hungary and Austria in Group F.</p><p>The Euros in France start on June 10.</p>]]></storybody>
