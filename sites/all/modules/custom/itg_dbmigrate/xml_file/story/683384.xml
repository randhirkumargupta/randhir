<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Delhi University's online admission has taken a toll on the roadside vendors in the campus. Every year, the admission season is the peak time when the roadside vendors make money as large numbers of aspirants visit the campus to submit forms. But this year is going to be dry for them.</p><p><b>RUNNING INTO LOSSES</b></p><p>Fifty-year-old Lal Dev has been selling banta outside the Arts faculty for the last ten years. With the admission process every year, Dev keeps his hopes high for his business to flourish.</p><p>The admission season is a golden time for all the banta walas. The banta, or fresh lime soda, brings some relief to the students in the scorching heat. </p><p>"There are very few students on the campus this year. The business is not picking up. Till last year, many students used to visit the colleges so they used to come to us. I have not sold more than 10 bottles in the last two days," Dev said.</p><p>The cost of one banta is Rs 10 and they manage to earn Rs 1,500 per day. But this year, they are not happy. As you walk through the campus lanes, roadside vendors selling chunky jewellery will catch your attention. But this year, they are also complaining. "We are getting no customers this time. We don't know the reason but there is hardly any crowd on the campus," said Rani Devi, sitting outside the metro station at Delhi University.</p><p>The university, for the first time, has made the entire admission process online this year. The number of applicants who registered online for admission to undergraduate courses of Delhi University swelled to over 87,000 on the second day of application process on Thursday. "The total number of applicants who completed their registration on Thursday is 87,748, of which 25,241 have made payments," said Kirti Ranjan, OSD Admissions. The online registration had begun on Wednesday with 39,000 applications registering on the very first day.</p><p>On the other hand, with the admission process going online, cyber caf√©s, located near Patel Chest Institute, have picked up business. And they are not shy in charging money. Considering the demand of the internet usage, the shop owners are charging accordingly. While a student belonging to a reserved category will have to pay around Rs 100-150 apart from the registration fee, the students from general category have to pay Rs 100-200. "I came to the university to attend the open day session. I don't want to waste time in going back and filling the form. Many of us have decided to fill the forms from the nearby cafes. They are charging Rs 150 more apart from the registration fee," said Alka Arora, an aspirant from Jamshedpur.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/high-five-for-dus-online-admissions/1/683144.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/high-five-for-dus-online-admissions/1/683144.html">Also read: DU admissions: Meet the high five of Admission Management System</a> </b></p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
