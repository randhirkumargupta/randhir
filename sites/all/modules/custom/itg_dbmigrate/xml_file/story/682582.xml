<storykicker><![CDATA[Chinese Foreign Ministry tells India Today it has asked Pakistan "to take concrete measures to protect Chinese institutions and personnel" after bomb attack in Karachi.<br /><br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>China has asked Pakistan "to take concrete measures" to protect its personnel after a bomb attack on Monday left a Chinese engineer wounded, raising fresh concerns over future Chinese projects in the country.</p><p><b>CHINESE INJURED IN BOMB ATTACK</b></p><p>The roadside bomb attack on the Chinese engineer left him and his driver injured, with local police authorities quoted saying the attack in a Karachi suburb "was aimed at the Chinese national". A group identifying itself as the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement that it was opposed to Chinese investments and that "the world's most plunderous nation has set its eye on Sindh", Reuters reported.</p><p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed to India Today in Beijing that one Chinese citizen was slightly wounded in the bomb attack.</p><p>"He has returned to his residence safely after receiving medical treatment," the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p><b>CHINESE ASKED TO HEIGHTEN THEIR SECURITY </b></p><p>The ministry added that China had attached "high importance" to the incident and that the Embassy in Islamabad and Consulate-General in Karachi "instantly lodged representations with the Pakistani side, asking them to get to the bottom of this incident and take concrete measures to protect Chinese institutions and personnel". Local Chinese have also been advised to "heighten their security alert".</p><p>The attack comes as China has stepped up investment in Pakistan, going forward with a $46 billion economic corridor project.</p><p>In a May visit to Beijing, Pakistan's Army Chief Raheel Sharif assured the Chinese government that the security of Chinese personnel and investments would be protected. According to reports, the Pakistani army has set up a force of 20,000 personnel dedicated to protect Chinese projects and workers.</p><p>While voicing concerns about the attack, the Foreign Ministry said it appreciated the Pakistani government's efforts to ensure the safety of Chinese companies.</p><p>"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the consensus between governments of the two countries, which has won extensive support from the two peoples," the Foreign Ministry said.</p><p>"We appreciate that the Pakistani side attaches great importance to and makes all-out efforts to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens and companies in Pakistan. We believe that the Pakistani side will continue to take effective measures to assure the building of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and safe, stable and smooth progress of the Corridor projects."</p><p><b>MORE ABOUT CPEC PROJECT</b></p><p>Hundreds of Chinese personnel are employed in projects as part of the CPEC, although the Foreign Ministry said it did not immediately have accurate figures on hand of the number of Chinese citizens currently in Pakistan.</p><p>The more than 3,000 km-long corridor runs from Kashgar in China's western Xinjiang province to the Gwadar port that China has helped build and manage on the Arabian Sea. The project envisages a widening of the Karakoram Highway, construction of roads in Pakistan and energy projects, while feasibility studies into a railway line and pipeline are on-going. Pakistan officials have said the total investment value could rise to $ 46 billion, although China hasn't officially confirmed that figure.</p><p>Part of the corridor runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) which borders Xinjiang, and India has voiced its opposition to projects in PoK.</p><p>The CPEC has been pushed as a landmark initiative of President Xi Jinping's "One Belt, One Road" plan, which envisages building a land Silk Road economic belt from China to Central Asia and Europe, as well as a Maritime Silk Road to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean Region.</p>]]></storybody>
