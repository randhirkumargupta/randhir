<storybody><![CDATA[<p>RSS-backed coaching institute Samkalp has claimed to have produced over 60 per cent of Indian Civil Services officers selected this year, claimed the institute administration in a letter written to its executive.&nbsp;</p><p>The coaching institute would be organising a ceremony on July 17 in Delhi to felicitate all those selected to the IAS under its guidance and the event would be addressed by none other than RSS sar karyavah Krishnagopal.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the claims of the institute, as many as 646 or 60 per cent of the successful IAS candidates this year have taken guidance from RSS-affiliated swayamsevaks.&nbsp;</p><p><b>RECORDS BROKEN</b>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Samkalp, the programme would be attended also by former Union minister Jagmohan and Gujarat governor OP Kohli. The institute has named the event 'Guru Samman Samaroh-2016'. This is not the first time that Samkalp would be organising this kind of an event. According to RSS sources, Samkalp has been organising Guru Samman Samarohs to felicitate successful UPSC aspirants every year and that these events have always been graced by the presence of top RSS functionaries and senior leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>This year's event has assumed greater significance compared to the past as the number of such candidates that it coached and who have been successful has broken all past records, claimed the organisation.&nbsp;</p><p>Samkalp claims that out of the top 100 rankers in the 2016 UPSC exams, as many as 76 have been associated with Samkalp, a feat since its inception. The institute sources claimed that since its inception, it has been behind the success of almost 5,000 UPSC aspirants.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, RSS has expanded its network among civil servants in all the states. The institute was founded in 2001 in Delhi by retired civil servants who had also been associated with the RSS and its ideology. The coaching institute was founded with the aim of providing guidance to weaker sections of the society.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/upsc-civil-services-exam/1/683251.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/upsc-civil-services-exam/1/683251.html">Also read: </a><a target="_blank">Things you must know before you start preparing for UPSC civil services examination</a></b>  </p>]]></storybody>
