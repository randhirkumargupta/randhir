<storybody><![CDATA[<p>According to the Uttar Pradesh Police, Mathura violence mastermind  Ramvriksh Yadav is dead now and his body has been identified by his  associates.</p><p>Family members of the Mathura cult leader, who clashed with the police on Thursday in Mathura, have been intimated to identify his body for final confirmation.</p><p>Yadav (55) was a resident of Raipur Bagpur village, under Mardah police station of Ghazipur district, and was leading the protesters under the umbrella 'Swadheen Bharat Vidhik Satyagrah'. Originally a farmer, he had reportedly moved to Mathura with his family some three years ago. </p><p>A violent clash between the police and activists of the Azad Bharat 
Vidhik Vaicharik Kranti Satyagrahi and the Swadheen Bharat Subhash Sena, left 24 people dead in Mathura, including an SP and an SHO. Yadav was accused of leading the violence and running a camp backed by a private army divided into units which had taken over Mathura's Jawahar Bagh - a 280-acre-property. <br /></p><p>Earlier, local administration claimed that Yadav got burnt in the fire set off by his followers and probably died in the same, but there was no official confirmation and teams were setup to search for him. Cops suspected that he was living in some neighbouring district around Mathura. It was also suspected that he might have returned to his native town Ghazipur.</p><iframe src="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/embed/is7s644mjk" mce_src="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/embed/is7s644mjk" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="396" width="648"></iframe>

<p>Three injured rioters, including one identified as Mahesh of Siddharth Nagar, died in SN Medical College Agra today. The other two remain unidentified. The arrested rioters have been shifted from Mathura to Aligarh, Agra, Etah and Firozabad jails, while kids have been sent to Juvenile correction centers and women to the women shelter in Mathura.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a target="_blank" href="Jawahar Bagh was the personal fiefdom of rebel leader Ramvriksh Yadav http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jawahar-bagh-was-the-personal-fiefdom-of-rebel-leader-ramvriksh-yadav/1/683710.html">Jawahar Bagh was the personal fiefdom of rebel leader Ramvriksh Yadav</a></b>  <br /></p><p><b>What the media says about Ramvriksh Yadav: </b></p>                            {funfacts}<div class="conclace-story-wrapper"><div class="dotted-line"></div><div class="conclace-heading"></div>
