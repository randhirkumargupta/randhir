<storykicker><![CDATA[The May 19 edition of the Globe Magazine had a cover saying "Charles caught kissing boy toy", that he has been disowned by William and Kate and that his wife Camilla is demanding divorce. What's the truth?<br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p><b>Is Prince Charles gay?&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Was he 'caught' kissing a 'boy toy'?</b></p><p><b>Is Queen Elizabeth upset? Will she not crown him the king?</b></p><p><b>Are William and Kate mad at Prince Charles? </b></p><p><br />The cover of May 19 edition of an American tabloid, Globe, that says "Charles caught kissing boy toy" with a photo of Prince and a young man sharing what seems like an intimate moment. The cover also says "Prince DISOWNED by humiliated William and Kate!" and "Furious wife Camilla DEMANDS divorce!"</p><p>{mosimage} <br /></p><p><br />Yes, <b>'disowned'</b> and <b>'demands'</b> in capital letters! This is not the first time the Globe is reporting this. See another cover of Globe (June 3, 2013) that says "Prince Charles Is Gay".</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp; </p><p>Globe's May 19 story says the Buckingham Palace is in shock and upset about facing a fresh 'gay' scandal after Prince Harry. The story begins with "Prince Charles' "secret gay life has been blown wide open by shocking photos of the love-sick royal in a sizzling lip-lock with his toy boy beau!" and says Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth, is 'stunned' by the images and now 'more determined than ever' to make her favourite grandchild, Prince William, her heir.<br /></p><p>The article goes on to say "After greeting his secret lover, the prince and the handsome young man embrace and share a passionate and deep kiss." They also dare to write "Certainly, Charles' taste for men comes as no surprise to his wife, Camilla, says a royal insider," and even accuses her of "taking Charles' homosexuality to her advantage to accomplish her lifetime dream of being named queen." Not stopping there, Globe also says once she's named the queen, she would walk away from the marriage with a king's ransom. &nbsp; </p><p><b><br />What is the history between Globe and the Windsors?</b></p><p>Globe has, in the past, published stories that said Queen Elizabeth is on the death bed and has decided to pass the throne to William, and not Charles, they had a story which said Princess Diana having a secret daughter and one that said Kate is pregnant with twins. Globe has a reputation of carrying stories that are products of its writer's imagination and not based on any solid evidence.&nbsp; </p><p>Even the latest article, with photographs to support their claim, doesn't seem very convincing.</p><p><br /><b>Earlier allegations on Prince Charles</b> <br /></p><p>In 2003, George Anthony Smith, a former footman and valet to Charles, claimed to have seen Charles and Michael Fawcett, one of Charles' favourite servant, having sex one morning when he went to Charle's bedroom to serve him breakfast. Smith also alleged that he was raped by Fawcett. Smith's allegations were rubbished by Simon Solari, another ex-servant, saying "It would not have been in Smith's remit to attend the prince or serve him tea in his bedroom, that was a job for the senior valet," and that the Prince of Wales does not have breakfast in his bed. <br /></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><br />Charles' tampon statement</b></p><p>A private conversation between Prince Charles and his wife Camilla had leaked and Charles was heard saying he'd want to reincarnate as a tampon she would use.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Can this man be gay? </b><br /></p><p><br />For all we know, he could be. Or he could be straight, or even a bisexual. Should his sexuality really matter?&nbsp; <br /></p>]]></storybody>
