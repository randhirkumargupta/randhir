<storykicker><![CDATA[And you thought your weekend spa was indulgence? Well, if you haven't 
let snakes slither on your bare body, you haven't experienced anything.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>There's literally no one on Planet Earth who doesn't like being pampered. If you do, you're just plain weird. Go away!</p><p>For the other, saner creatures, we have a list of the craziest spas EVER! From downright weird to just plain stupid--the list of world's wackiest spa treatments/therapies is as interesting as stupid. So, go ahead, indulge.&nbsp; <br /></p><p><b>1. Placenta Facial</b><br />Like all things "off-beat", this one too is said to have originated in Asia. Yes, that's actual human placenta we're talking about. In 2008, CNN had reported that a Beverly Hills skin center was offering treatments using human placentas--obtained from Russian maternity wards--for USD 350 to USD 500 a session. Some studies do suggest that placenta-based beauty treatments work wonders for sun and acne-ravaged skin How Stuff Works reports that a Singapore-based company, Maylande, markets a facial treatment made from human placentas that it obtains in Japan. Its placenta-based products include a tonic, a soap, a facial mask and others, which it claims provide a range of benefits, from clear skin to brain stimulation.</p><p><b>2. Beer Bath, Czech Republic </b></p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>Like your beer? Now, give each inch of your body the chance to devour it. How? By bathing in it, of course. It's called a brewski, and it's a rather popular concept in Czech Republic. Since 2006, the Chodovar family brewery--the "beer wellness land"--has been offering visitors a 20-minute beer bath in a tub of a special "bathing beer", brewed especially to stimulate the skin and internal organs. But that's not all--Chodovar also accompanies this with a complimentary mug of the brewery's rock lager, for USD 29. </p><p><b>3. Snail Spa, Japan</b></p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>Seen a snail slither away on the ground during the monsoon? What does that slimy little creature leave behind? A weird mucus, right? Yup, that's the mucus that's said to be beneficial for the human skin. According to Telegraph, the mucus left behind by the snail contains a beauty-boosting cocktail of proteins, antioxidants and hyaluronic acid. So, if you're ready--mentally and physically--to let snails slither away slowly all over your face (including lips), head to Japan, NOW! </p><p><b>4. Snake Spa, Israel</b></p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>Yup, snails were not weird enough, which is why some mighty people came up with the idea of letting snakes slither on your body. Said to have been conceptualised in Israel, this therapy usually involves California and Florida king snakes, corn snakes and milk snakes, finding their way on your bare torso. The larger ones apparently alleviate muscle pain, while the smaller ones create a 'fluttering' sensation, reports Telegraph. </p><p><b>5. Volcano Sand Bathing</b></p><p><b></b>{mosimage}</p><p>If someone told you volcanic sand is therapeutic, would you believe them? Well, okay. Now, if they told you that you are to lie down and let them pour hot volcanic sand on you, would you turn around and run for your life?&nbsp; </p><p>It's quite the therapy, though. Sand bathing involves getting buried in a large pit of volcanic sand for up to 30 minutes. The experience is said to be soothing as well as satisfying, while being highly therapeutic. It is apparently great for treating infertility, diabetes, anaemia and asthma, and is also said to help one lose weight. The bathing areas consist of a huge boxes of sand, heated up with natural hot spring water. When the sand is thoroughly soaked in the water and is steaming hot, the water is drained. Visitors are then let into the box and asked to lie down, as workers shovel copious amounts of sand on top of them. The bathers remain buried until the sand cools down, and are then directed to bathing facilities to wash the dirt off, reports Oddity Central.</p><p><b>6. Cactus Massage, Mexico</b></p><p><b></b>{mosimage}</p><p>No, the thorns won't bite. people are not THAT stupid. This kind of treatment is given after the needles of the cactus are removed and mixed with things like chocolate, vanilla or honey to give it a more ornamental look. The massage promises to rehydrate your muscles and remove toxins from your body, thanks to the use of Nopal paddies of the cactus plant. A 50-minute massage will cost you up to USD 180, according to beforeitsnews.com. <br /></p>]]></storybody>
