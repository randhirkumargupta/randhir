<storybody><![CDATA[<p>A group of five IT students from Delhi University gave up lucrative jobs offers and decided to stay and work in the varsity two years ago. Working as interns, these students have designed the much-talked about Admission Management System, which has enabled the varsity to take its entire admission process online this year. </p><p><b>THUMBS UP</b></p><p>Delhi University kicked off the online admission process for the under-graduate courses from Wednesday and in the first six hours, the University portal has already registered more than 30,000 applicants out of which 5,600 have paid the fees too. "From the last two-three years, we have been working with the students to understand their needs. We wanted to break the myth that government institutions cannot achieve professional levels. It's for the first time that Delhi University has gone completely online for admissions to under-graduate (UG) courses," Dr Sanjeev Singh, associate professor at Institute of Informatics &amp; Communication (IIC) told Mail Today.</p><p>Former students of DU's Institute of Informatics &amp; Communication (IIC) are the masterminds behind the digital change. The work on the online admission system for this year began on May 25 and since then, the team has not slept. Receiving an overwhelming response on the first day of the admissions, the team is excited as well as emotional. "It feels great. The response we have received from the students is overwhelming. We had a holistic idea of creating a system like this, which could be seamless and error-free, and most-importantly students' friendly. With such a software, a sense of e-governance can be achieved," Sharad Mishra, one of the interns told Mail Today. The system was used for the admissions to post-graduate (PG) courses and is already a success. As per the latest report, more than 1.29 lakh applicants have submitted their application as a part of the intake process. </p><p>Out of the total number of applicants, a total of 1, 02,667 are from general category. "We get an hourly statistics of the applicants and the registration process. The data has been divided into various categoriesmale, female, course popularity, state and district," added Mishra. Even a few hours before going on roll, the interns were arguing over the colour of the button to be used during the online admission process. "It's an ongoing process. We want to improvise every year and this is the right way. We spoke to each and every college and coordinated with them for the application process. The discussions have been going on for very long," Divya Karwan, another intern told Mail Today. </p><p>An animated movie has also been made, giving details about filling up the application form online. The movie has been uploaded on YouTube. "Recently, we got a call from a student from Andaman&amp; Nicobar Islands and he wanted to know about the process. Through the system, we will be able to reach out to the remote areas of the country where innovation is required," said Mukesh Rawat, another intern. Other educational institutions are now approaching them for help. The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), CBSE, NCERT and Ambedkar University have approached the group to integrate the process in their system.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/delhi-university-admissions-2016/1/682322.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/delhi-university-admissions-2016/1/682322.html">Also read: Delhi University Admissions process to begin from today: How to apply</a> </b></p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
