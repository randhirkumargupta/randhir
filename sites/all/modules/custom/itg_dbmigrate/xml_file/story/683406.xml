<storybody><![CDATA[<p>There are times when offense can be a good defence. Micromax, which is India's biggest phone maker, believes for it that time is now. Even as it fights to defend its turf here in India from Chinese firms, the company is planning to enter China in 2017. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/indias-micromax-plans-to-sell-smartphones-in-china-go-public-1464845743-lMyQjAxMTA2NzA0MjcwOTI5Wj">announcement was made</a>  by Micromax co-founder Vikas Jain at RISE conference in Hong Kong on Thursday.</p><p>Jain reportedly said that the firm Micromax believes China to be an important market in future given the size of the phone business in that country. Also to ensure that it is well-equipped to take on the companies like Vivo, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi and Lenovo, Micromax would raise additional funds in the next two years, either privately or by going public.</p><p>Although it sounds like a plan, for Micromax China may not turn out to be an easy market even though it is the world's biggest phone market. Nearly 500 million phones were sold in China in 2015 and Micromax definitely believes that it can get a slice of this burgeoning market. While there are a lot of similarities between the Chinese and Indian market - value conscious buyers and same set of companies - the software and the hardware that goes inside the phones in China can vary significantly compared to phones sold in global markets.</p><p>Entering China is also tricky for an Indian company like Micromax because the Android phones sold in China don't have the Google Play store installed on them. Instead the version of Android on most Chinese phones is heavily modified and has many local components.</p><p>In comparison, it is easier for Chinese companies to enter other markets such as India. In the last few years a lot of Chinese phone makers, including Xiaomi and Lenovo, have focussed heavily on India and have managed to make inroads into the segment of market that were once ruled by Micromax.</p><p class="review_quote"><em class="fa fa-quote-left"></em>   Entering China is also tricky for an Indian company like Micromax because the Android phones sold in China don't have the Google Play store installed on them <em class="fa fa-quote-right"></em></p><p>The Indian company is still the second biggest in the country, behind Samsung but its growth has slowed down steadily in the last couple of quarters. "Micromax retained second position in Q1, 2016 with 6.9 per cent growth over the same period last year. However, shipments fell 17.9 per cent sequentially for the second consecutive quarter as volume dipped sharply in the entry level sub- $75 segment," <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/lenovo-slips-to-fourth-position-as-q1-16-sees-decline-in-smartphone-shipments-idc-india/1/670123.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/lenovo-slips-to-fourth-position-as-q1-16-sees-decline-in-smartphone-shipments-idc-india/1/670123.html">IDC had noted recently</a>  in its market report for India. Micromax, according to IDC, has 12.6 per cent market share in India.</p><p>The company knows this. In April, the company <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/micromax-revamps-brand-unveils-new-logo-and-19-products/1/641669.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/micromax-revamps-brand-unveils-new-logo-and-19-products/1/641669.html">publicly announced</a>  that it was re-branding itself and was changing the business strategy to deal with challenges in a better way. Since then Micromax has launched several new products across categories - phones tablets, laptops etc - to rekindle the growth. Yu, which is a sub-brand of the company looked after by co-founder Rahul Sharma, has also launched the Yunicorn, a new device aimed at competing with the likes of Xiaomi and Lenovo in India.</p><p class="review_also_read"><strong>Also read: </strong> <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/yu-yunicorn-full-specifications-top-features-india-price-and-everything-you-need-to-know/1/681505.html

</a></p><p>However, if Micromax is finding it difficult to compete with Chinese companies in India, in China it may find the market even more challenging. Such is the nature of the Chinese market that even companies like Xiaomi and Lenovo are finding it difficult to stay among the top firms. Success in one quarter doesn't mean zilch in the Chinese phone market and the companies on an upswing may find their fortunes take a tumble within weeks. In the market report for the first quarter, IDC had noted that Xiaomi and Lenovo were no longer among the top 5 companies in the world, mostly because of the hit they took in China.</p><p>"Along China's maturing smartphone adoption curve, the companies most aligned with growth are those with products serving increasingly sophisticated consumers. Lenovo benefited in 2013, and Xiaomi (won in) 2014 and 2015. Now Huawei, OPPO, and Vivo, which play mainly are positioned for a strong 2016," said Melissa Chau, senior research manager with IDC. "These new vendors would be well-advised not to rest on their laurels though, as this dynamic smartphone landscape has shown to even cult brands like Xiaomi that customer loyalty is difficult to consistently maintain."</p><p class="review_also_read"><strong>Also read: </strong> <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/micromax-says-people-are-loving-nuts-guts-glory/1/664364.html " mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/micromax-says-people-are-loving-nuts-guts-glory/1/664364.html " title="">  Micromax says people are loving 'Nuts.
