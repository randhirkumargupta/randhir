<storykicker><![CDATA[As Thursday's bloodshed in Mathura shook the nation, UP police chief 
Javed Ahmed acknowledged his men inspecting the seized grounds didn't 
know the occupiers were "so heavily armed."<br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>In little over two years, they built an arsenal of firearms and bombs in Mathura's largest public park. They blatantly stole electricity and water and virtually declared the 268-acre patch they have been occupying as a selfruled dominion.</p><p>Their criminal record in Mathura's police files is no state secret. Many of them face trials for murder attempts, assaults, abductions, threats and land grabbing. Squatting on government land is commonplace in India. But the occupiers of Mathura's Jawahar Bagh were no ordinary, docile encroachers. But police appear to have been complacently unprepared when they arrived at the scene to survey the situation before executing court-ordered evictions of the site.</p><p>Occupiers espousing anti-establishment attitudes unleashed a bloody assault on the police team, firing shots from treetops and hurling grenades. Over the past two years, Jawahar Bagh had been turned into a personal regime of the activists of an obscure cult, who describe themselves as "Satyagrahis." Yet, the law-enforcers of India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh had little idea that the park had become a home to stockpiles of weapons and aggressive thugs.</p><p>As Thursday's bloodshed in Mathura shook the nation, UP police chief Javed Ahmed acknowledged his men inspecting the seized grounds didn't know the occupiers were "so heavily armed." In the bloody firefight that unfolded during police survey, Mathura lost its superintendent and a station house officer. "They attacked us without any provocation. The miscreants used explosive materials, including gas cylinders. There fired sitting on trees," Ahmed said.</p><p><b>FAILURE</b></p><p>Uttar Pradesh's additional director-general of police, Daljeet Singh Chaudhary, admitted failure in stopping what he called was a "gradual encroachment" of Jawahar Bagh. He, however, skirted a reply when asked whether there was also an intelligence failure that could have allowed them to attack police. Officers also flew a drone to film the area and make an assessment of the exact strength of the occupiers. But the device got stuck in trees and failed to sent back images. Still, police went ahead for their recce.</p><p>Meanwhile, there was somberness in the air when colleagues and citizens arrived to pay homage to slain SP Mukul Dwiedi. UP Police was represented by ADG law and order and Principle Secretary as UP government was conspicuous by its absence as casualty figures rose to 24.</p><p>UP DGP Javed Ahmed held a press conference in Mathura and said that "All those involved in the attack will be booked under NSA. More than 320 people have been arrested and the three main members led by the founder of this sect Ram Vriksha Yadav are still absconding." In the backdrop of the violence, politicians across parties launched a fierce attack on each other. Home Minister Rajnath Singh was first of the block when he tweeted that he had telephoned UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and offered assistance.</p><p>But his deputy Kiran Rijiju was quick to signal that the gloves were off. He said that all this happened due to the lapse of the state government.</p><p>On the back foot, a defensive CM Akhilesh Yadav pledged an impartial inquiry.</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-violence-dm-rajesh-kumar-ssp-rakesh-kumar-suspended-for-negligence/1/683559.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-violence-dm-rajesh-kumar-ssp-rakesh-kumar-suspended-for-negligence/1/683559.html">Also read: </a><a target="_blank">Mathura violence: 11 rioters died in fire set to their own shacks</a></b>  </p>]]></storybody>
