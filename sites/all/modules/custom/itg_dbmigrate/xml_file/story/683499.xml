<storykicker><![CDATA[The report claims that Apple will be making the India-centric announcement at the next iPhone launch in India.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>It seems Tim Cook's dinner party with Bollywood big names was not just some fun party. Business too was discussed probably at this party hosted by Shah Rukh Khan. According to a report by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pc-tablet.co.in/apple-reportedly-appoint-bollywood-star-shahrukh-khan-brand-ambassador-india/30657/" mce_href="http://www.pc-tablet.co.in/apple-reportedly-appoint-bollywood-star-shahrukh-khan-brand-ambassador-india/30657/">PC Tablet</a> , Apple may soon announce Khan the company's brand ambassador for India.</p><p><b>Update: </b>We are hearing from Apple sources that this is not true. At least for now there is no decision at Apple to make Khan a brand ambassador. Although, we have also asked Apple spokesperson for a comment and will update if we get one.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>The report comes after <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/day-1-of-tim-cooks-india-visit-dinner-with-srk-and-8-other-things-apple-ceo-did-in-mumbai/1/671594.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/day-1-of-tim-cooks-india-visit-dinner-with-srk-and-8-other-things-apple-ceo-did-in-mumbai/1/671594.html">Tim Cook's visit</a>  to the Bollywood star's bungalow Mannat earlier last month. </p><p>The report claims that Apple will be making the India-centric announcement at the next iPhone launch in India. This may also suggest a possible partnership between Apple and Red Chillies Entertainment for Apple Music and TV services. The film production house was founded by Shah Rukh Khan and his wife Gauri Khan.<br />

</p><p class="review_also_read"><b>Also Read: </b> <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/beyond-headlines-tim-cooks-visit-is-start-of-apples-india-dream/1/674941.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/beyond-headlines-tim-cooks-visit-is-start-of-apples-india-dream/1/674941.html" title="">

Beyond headlines, Tim Cook's visit is start of Apple's India dream
</a></p>
Apple's partnership with Shah Rukh Khan is not new. Last year, when the company launched Apple Music in India, it made a playlist of SRK's famous songs in a bid to entice users.<p>Tim Cook had said during his visit that the company needed to rethink its India strategy in order to tap the market, which is dominated by Android phones.</p><p>Earlier last month when Apple CEO Tim Cook visited India, his first evening in the country was spent among celebrities at SRK's bungalow in Mumbai.</p><p>Cook also met Mahesh Bhatt, Farha Khan and other Bollywood directors. It has been reported earlier that Apple may launch its TV services in India soon. So it would be safe to assume that Apple may contract film-makers to provide content for Apple TV.</p><p>The news shouldn't come as a surprise as it has become a trend, especially with smartphone makers, in India to make film stars brand ambassadors.</p><p>Most of the brands have one or other celebrity to sell their products. Recently Asus contracted with Sonakshi Sinha for the ZenFone Max phone. Earlier Micromax had hired Hugh Jackman for its Canvas phones.</p>]]></storybody>
