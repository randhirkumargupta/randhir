<storykicker><![CDATA[<p>Authorities went to check up on the woman and found her dead from a 
gunshot wound. She had reportedly been dead for a couple of days.</p>]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles police on Thursday identified the man who killed a professor before committing suicide at the University of California, Los Angeles as Mainak Sarkar, a former doctoral student and an IITian.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 'kill list' police discovered through his suicide note led them to a Minnesota woman who was found dead in her home.</p><p><b>"CHECK ON MY CAT"</b></p><p>In his suicide note, Sarkar wrote "check on my cat" and gave his Minnesota address.</p><p>Los Angeles chief of police Charlie Beck said the note made them highly suspicious and uneasy. "That made me uneasy about what we would find when we got to Minnesota," he said, according to Los Angeles Times.</p><p>At Sarkar's home, police found a 'kill list' with three names - two UCLA professors (including the one he shot later) and one woman from Minnesota.</p><p>A cat named Kitty was also found, according to the LA Times report.</p><p>Authorities went to check up on the woman and found her dead from a gunshot wound. She had reportedly been dead for a couple of days.<br /><b><br />AN ACADEMIC WHO SNAPPED<br /></b><br />In 2000, Sarkar graduated from Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur with a degree in aerospace engineering.</p><p>Before enrolling at UCLA, Sarkar earned a master's degree from Stanford University, according to his LinkedIn page. The profile is now unavailable.{mosimage}</p><p>He also worked as a research assistant at the University of Texas and worked as a software developer.</p><p>At UCLA, Sarkar was a former doctoral student of William Klug - the professor he shot dead.</p><p>Before going to the US, Sarkar worked for Infosys in Bengaluru from 2000 to 2001.</p><p>After UCLA, he worked as an engineering analyst for an Ohio-based rubber company, Endurica LLC, until August 2014. </p><p><b>BEEF WITH THE PROFESSOR </b></p><p>On Wednesday, Sarkar shot dead engineering professor William Klug, 39, in a small office on the campus. </p><p>The attack appeared to be provoked by Sarkar's belief that Klug had stolen computer code from him, according to a March blog post by a person of the same name.</p><p>"Your enemy is my enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm," Sarkar wrote in the post. "Be careful about whom you trust."</p><p>The authenticity of the post is yet to be verified. The Los Angeles Times quoted an unnamed university source as saying the claims made in the blog were "untrue" and "absolutely psychotic."</p><p>In 2013, however, Sarkar had in his doctoral dissertation expressed gratitude to Klug for his help and support. "Thank you for being my mentor," he had written.</p><p><b>STUDENTS GRIM</b></p><p>Students are leaving flowers and cards in front of the engineering building at UCLA, to pay respects to the slain professor.<br /></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There's a memorial at the Bruin Bear today in honor of professor William Klug. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCLAShooting?src=hash" mce_href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCLAShooting?src=hash">#UCLAShooting</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCLAStrong?src=hash" mce_href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCLAStrong?src=hash">#UCLAStrong</a> <a href="https://t.co/l9C9NRehLu" mce_href="https://t.co/l9C9NRehLu">pic.twitter.com/l9C9NRehLu</a></p>Matt Joye (@mattjoye) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattjoye/status/738465133958045696" mce_href="https://twitter.com/mattjoye/status/738465133958045696">June 2, 2016</a></blockquote>
