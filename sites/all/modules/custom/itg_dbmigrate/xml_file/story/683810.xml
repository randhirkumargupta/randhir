<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The epicentre of violent Jat protests - Rohtak, which had attracted nearly 10,000 Jat protesters in February this year, managed to get only 300 Jats today when All-India Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) kicked off its protest. <br /></p><p>Similar number of Jats reached at Mayyad in Hisar but other locations like Madloda in Panipat and Kurukshetra could only get a dozen protesters.</p><p>"This is the outcome of the appeal made by the district administration to locals including Jats and youth which confined people to their homes. They know that violence will only attract punishment," Duty Magistrate, Panipat Dalwinder Singh said.</p><p>Villagers at Nara - a hamlet close to Madloda were seen smoking Hookah under shady trees. Most of them were not in favour of a protest as they feared a police action.</p><p><b>STATE GOVERNMENT WARNED JATS OF ACTION</b><br /></p><p>It is worth mentioning that the state government by sending notices to Jat leaders had warned them of a stern action including attaching their properties if they incited people to attack properties. The state government has already slapped a sedition case against Yashpal Malik and four others of his faction.</p><p>Sources said Jats also avoided joining the protest as they are busy harvesting their crops. Yashpal Malik is considered an outsider by Haryana's Jats as he belongs to Uttar Pradesh.</p><p><b>WHAT JATS ARE DEMANDING</b></p><p><b></b>Despite poor show - Yashpal Malik faction, which had announced protests in 15 towns, said the protests are indefinite and will continue till the government accepts their demands.</p><p>The demands include release of arrested Jat activists, government jobs and a compensation of rupees ten lakh to those who were killed in police action.</p><p>Meanwhile, the state government is not taking any chances and has deployed 55 companies of para-military forces in nine districts. Section 144 has also been imposed in Jhajjar, Rohtak, Sonipat, Panipat, Bhiwani, Hisar, Fatehabad, Jind and Kaithal districts.</p><p>"Adequate security arrangements are in place to deal with any situation like road or rail blockade. Law and order situation is under control in the state," Additional Chief Secretary Home, Ram Niwas said.</p><p>30 people were killed and over 300 were injured during the 9-day Jat quota sir which rocked Haryanna in February this year.</p><p><b><iframe src="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/embed/is7s66mcdc" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="396" width="647"></iframe></b></p><p><b>Also read:</b></p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jat-quota-stir-government-jobs-high-alert-internet-banned-latest-updates/1/683749.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jat-quota-stir-government-jobs-high-alert-internet-banned-latest-updates/1/683749.html">Jats begin fresh quota stir, no reports of violence yet: Latest updates</a> <br /></b>&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
