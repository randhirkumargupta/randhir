<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Santosh Yadav, SHO Farah police station, who was killed in the Mathura violence last evening, was known for his bravery and was popularly known as Singham. Yadav died in an armed clash with the devotees of Baba Jaiguru Dev in Mathura when he along with a team of police and administrative officials had gone there to discuss and end a three-year-long "satyagrah" by the deceased Baba's devotees.</p><p>Yadav died on the spot when a bullet hit him in the head in a planned attack on the police team by the so-called satyagrahis.</p><p><b>THE COP WHO COULD'VE BECOME A DOC</b></p><p>Santosh Yadav had earlier planned a career in medicine. However, in 2001, he joined the ranks of the police force and over time rose to his current rank. In 2013, he was transferred from Agra to Mathura where his bravery in foiling a robbery attack earned him the sobriquet of Mathura's Singham.</p><p><b>HOW SANTOSH YADAV BECAME SINGHAM</b></p><p>According to media reports, on July 31, 2015, an incident of carjacking of a Tata Indica was reported from the expressway outside Mathura. A motorcycle was also reportedly robbed. Santosh Yadav, who was an SO at that time, immediately got into action and chased the robbers.</p><p>The robbers couldn't get too far as the rain and mud hampered them from driving both the vehicles away. Desperate to flee from the police, the robbers abandoned the vehicles and fled on foot at the same time, opening fire on the police force which was following close behind.</p><p>So Santosh Yadav, not worried about his own life, opened fire at the robbers and chased them. He managed to capture two robbers while a third one managed to escape.</p><p>This act of bravery earned him the title of Mathura's Singham.</p><p><b>CRACKING BANK ROBBERY CASES</b></p><p>Earlier in Agra, he had cracked a bank robbery in five days which had led to him receiving awards from the IG and DIG. Yadav was known for his ability to solve complicated cases.</p><p>Santosh Yadav who hailed from Uttar Pradesh's Jaunpur district was appointed as SI. His first posting was that of in-charge Shergarh. However, due to his work, he was soon appointed as head of the SWAT team. Under him, the SWAT team solved many cases which led to him being appointed the PRO to SSP. He was later moved to Yamuan Paar as station officer. From Yamuna Paar, Yadav was moved to Farah as SHO.</p><p>It had only been 20 days that Santosh Yadav had taken charge as SHO Farah before he undertook the operation to clear the 280-acre land in Jawaharbagh where he was killed.</p><p><b>ALSO READ</b>: </p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-clash-1-policeman-killed-several-others-injured-during-anti-encroachment-drive/1/683369.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-clash-1-policeman-killed-several-others-injured-during-anti-encroachment-drive/1/683369.html">Mathura clash: 1 policeman killed, several others injured during anti-encroachment drive</a></b><br /></p><iframe src="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/embed/is7s62vi1s" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="396" width="648"></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
