<storykicker><![CDATA[It's holiday time. These three healthy and wholesome recipes will keep both you and your little Masterchef happy. <br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>It's summer time and the inane fight over what's for breakfast might be hounding you like it does most moms. The battle to mishmash health and flavour is another tirade with most of you folks trying your best to please the kids with what's on offer from your recipes repertoire. If you are not the cereal and milk mom and believe in rustling up a nutritious platter for breakfast, then go no further. We got Chef Rakhee Vaswani, author of Picky Eater and founder Palate Culinary, the premium cooking institute that can boast of celebrity students like Malaika Arora Khan and Arjun Kapoor to give us three outstanding breakfast recipes. &nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/breakfast-in-a-bottle-2-healthy-easy-smoothies-make-sure-you-never-miss-breakfast-fruits-fresh-herbs-yogurt-chia-seeds-flaxseeds/1/675067.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/breakfast-in-a-bottle-2-healthy-easy-smoothies-make-sure-you-never-miss-breakfast-fruits-fresh-herbs-yogurt-chia-seeds-flaxseeds/1/675067.html"><u><b>Also read: Two healthy and easy smoothies to make sure you NEVER miss breakfast again</b></u></a> </p><p>If you harp on providing wholesome nourishment than you too must have not made the carcinogenic packaged bread a breakfast staple at your home. A recent study by the environment think tank, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) had discovered that 84 per cent of bread and bakery samples in the capital contain bromate, potassium iodate or both which can lead to thyroid cancers and disorders. "Parents can use many substitutes for breads like home-made wheat rotis, soya rotis, rye bread, corn tortillas. In fact, lettuce and other leafs can also be used to wrap veggies instead of breads. Sweet potatoes can be great substitutes for bread buns too," said Chef Vaswani. </p><p>Now, that is a novelty for bun substitutes. In the meanwhile, you can get the sous chefs in your own house ready to create up a storm in the kitchen with these super healthy recipes along with a calorie control tip from the Chef to ensure that you too can indulge in the same without any guilt. </p><p>&nbsp;<br /><b>Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise Sauce</b><br />Serves: 6 {mosimage}</p><p>Ingredients: <br /></p><p>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 Buns <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2-3 bacon strips <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 tsp white vinegar <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6 eggs <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;51/2 tbsp clarified butter <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 egg yolks <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1/2 tsp salt &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Few drops lime juice <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1/4 tsp pepper powder <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Butter to spread<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fresh chopped parsley, for garnish</p><p><br /><b>Method</b><br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Take 80 gms of butter and heat in a deep pan. This helps the solids separate. Remove the scum from the top. Switch off the gas and let it settle down. What you are left with is clarified butter on top.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat the egg yolks on a double boiler and add the clarified butter little by little, stirring constantly with a wire whisk or wooden spoon. Gradually add the lime juice. Keep stirring until it thickens. Your hollandaise sauce is ready. Add salt and pepper before serving.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown the bacon in a medium pan. Toast the buns and butter them.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a 10-inch non-stick pan and fill with water till it is half full. Add white vinegar. This will make the egg white cook faster so it does not spread. Bring to a slow boil. Gently break one of the eggs into the water (using a ring mould) taking care not to break it. Repeat with remaining eggs. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cook for 3Â½ minutes until the egg white is set and yolk remains soft. Remove with a slotted spoon, allowing the egg to drain. <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay a slice of bacon on top of each buttered bun, followed by a poached egg. Season it with salt and pepper. Spoon hollandaise sauce over the eggs. Garnish with chopped parsley.</p><p><b>Chef's tip</b><br />Using a ring mould helps the eggs poach better in a circle and not spread all over.</p><p><b>Calorie control</b><br />The chef recommends using Nutralite instead of regular butter and add a touch of creamy spinach to enhance the nutritional value. Alternatively, you can serve some smoked salmon with this. </p><p><br /><b>Banana Pancakes</b><br />Serves: 2 {mosimage}</p><p>Ingredients: <br /></p><p>"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;100 gms flour &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;100 gms oats &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 tbsp baking powder &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1/2 tsp baking soda &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1/2 tsp salt &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;30 gms sugar &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 egg &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 cup/200 ml skimmed milk/buttermilk<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 tbsp butter <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 mashed bananas<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Maple syrup as required<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whipped cream as required</p><p><b>Method</b></p><p>"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and oats.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In another bowl mix the milk, butter, egg and mashed.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Add the flour mixture, taking care not to over mix it.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heat a flat griddle or pan over medium-high heat.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spoon drops of the batter on the hot griddle and when bubbles appear on the surface of the little pancakes, flips them over to make them golden brown on both sides. A minute or so on each side should do it.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Serve hot with maple syrup and some whipped cream.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Add milk according to the size of the bananas. The batter should have a thick consistency like dosa batter. Alternatively, you can use a handful of blueberries instead of bananas.</p><p><br /><b>Calorie control</b><br />The chef recommends using egg white instead of the whole egg. Also you can opt for skimmed milk or buttermilk, or even almond milk-the latest healthier option rich in protein and less on calories. Try this switch and trust me, they won't even know the difference. In fact they may like it better.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/symmetrybreakfast-breakfasts-from-around-the-world-michael-zee-instagram-upcoming-book/1/669185.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/symmetrybreakfast-breakfasts-from-around-the-world-michael-zee-instagram-upcoming-book/1/669185.html"><u><b>Also read: Drool It: These 'symmetrical breakfast' posts have made this Instagrammer a phenomenon</b></u></a> <br /></p><p><b>Healthy Muesli</b><br />Serves: 10-15 {mosimage}</p><p>Ingredients: <br /></p><p>"&nbsp;&nbsp; 250gms oats <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 gms cranberries &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 gms almond flakes <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 gms sunflower seeds <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 gms pumpkin seeds &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 gms raisins &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 gms walnuts <br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 gms black currants &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 gms brown sugar &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 tbsp honey &nbsp;<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 gms butter, molten</p><p><b>Method</b><br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; In a bowl, mix the oats, almonds flakes, raisins, blackcurrants, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, cranberries and walnuts.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Add the brown sugar and honey.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Mix well. Add the melted butter.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Put it in a greased tin/silicon mold.<br />"&nbsp;&nbsp; Bake it at 140-160 degrees for 35 minutes or till the muesli is nice and golden.</p><p><b>Calorie control</b><br />Using brown sugar is healthier than white sugar as brown is raw and unrefined. Honey can also be substituted with molten jaggery (the quantity would be 2 tbsp less).</p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
