<storybody><![CDATA[<p>When Earl Nash, 43, forced herself into Mamadou Diallo's apartment saying "I don't want money, I'm going to rape you" to Diallo's wife Nenegale, he wouldn't have thought he'd be beaten to death by Diallo. </p><p>The New York Police Department said Nash is a serial offender and that he has been arrested 14 times since 1997 and has been convicted for peddling drugs and bribery in the past. &nbsp;</p><p>Diallo, a livery driver from Guinea, was not at his apartment when the incident happened. Nash pushed his way inside when Diallo's wife opened the door, thinking her children returned from school. Nash had a tough time fighting Nenegale and her sister who came to help. He also hit Nenegale with a chair.</p><p>While Nash was struggling to defend Nenegale's sister, she reached for her phone and dialled her husband's number and ensured she screamed so hard that he knew she's in trouble. When Nash tried to flee the scene, Nenegale went to the hallway and made a lot of noise hoping neighbours to intervene and not let him escape.</p><p>It took Diallo 20 minutes to reach his house where he involved in a violent scuffle with Nash, and ended up beating him with an iron rod. Nash died at a nearby hospital. Diallo was initially charged with manslaughter but his charges were downgraded later. He's now being hailed a hero and people are demanding for all charges against him to be dropped. </p><p>Speaking about the incident, Diallo told News 12, "I feel bad. I'm fighting for my family and myself. I don't want to be a hero. I don't want to be a killer."</p>]]></storybody>
