I was not offered a job and I have made it very clear that I would not be applying for any role with Cricket Australia."</p><p>Former South African quick Allan Donald will mentor Australia's bowlers for the upcoming Test series in Sri Lanka, while West Australia's Adam Griffith is in charge for the limited-overs series against West Indies and South Africa that precedes it.</p>]]></storybody>
