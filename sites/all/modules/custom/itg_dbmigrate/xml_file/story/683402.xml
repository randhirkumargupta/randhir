<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The Mathura Police has launched a massive manhunt for Ramvriksh Yadav, who is believed to be the mastermind of yesterday's violence in the city in which 24 people, including two cops were killed. According to official sources, it was Yadav who had provoked people inside Jawahar Bagh to attack the police contingent.</p><p>Twelve teams have been formed to nab Yadav, however, the police has had little success so far. </p><p>Over 2500 people were inside Jawahar Bagh when the police launched the anti-encroachment drive to push out the illegal occupants who have been living there for the past two years. Police and local administration had tried to clear the place but failed. </p><p><b>INTELLIGENCE FAILURE</b></p><p>Sources said the state government may take action against top police officers stationed in Mathura as they failed to gauge the situation. The Mathura Police also failed to gather any information about the number and strength of the people inside Jawahar Bagh.</p><p>A probe panel has been formed under supervision of the Commissioner of Aligarh whowill submit report on the whole incident. </p><p>"Will see the (UP government's)report. This shouldn't have happened, UP government should look into why this happened.<i> Bahut badi chook hui hai</i> (There has been a big lapse)," Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said.</p><p><b>POLITICAL SUPPORT</b></p><p>While locals in Mathura have blamed the police of deliberately turning a blind eye towards the issue in Jawahar Bagh due political pressure, the cops have denied it.</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-riots-hema-malini-akhilesh-yadav-bose-sena/1/683508.html" target="_blank">Baba Jai Gurudev, the godman whose followers are behind the Mathura riots</a> </b><br /></p><p>Police action came only after a high court's deadline to evict the land grabbers.
