<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Nobody can contest the fact that MasterChef Australia (MC Au) is one of the most influential cooking shows on television. The show is in its 8th season, and anybody who's watching it regularly would confirm that this is one show where talent of the contestants seems to be growing every year. The level of cooking, the techniques used and the plating styles are unbelievably, awe-inspiringly beautiful. Viewers, especially the ones who religiously follow MC Au, have picked up a lot about the culinary world. </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>This includes information about renowned chefs from all over the world, outstanding restaurants, plating trends, recent food fads (even really old food fads and trends, like apricot chicken and jaffle-makers), and most importantly, cooking techniques. The Indian audience knows how to treat spices with respect and a deft hand, something the Australians and even the rest of the world, is still trying to learn from us. But we don't usually come across techniques like basting, ceviche and ballotines, because these aren't culturally relevant.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/masterchef-australia-season-8-indian-contestants-nidhi-mahajan-rishi-desai-neha-sen-deepali-behar-dalwinder-dhami/1/664581.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/masterchef-australia-season-8-indian-contestants-nidhi-mahajan-rishi-desai-neha-sen-deepali-behar-dalwinder-dhami/1/664581.html"><u><b>Also read: Nidhi Mahajan To Rishi Desai: Know all about the Indian contestants on MasterChef Australia </b></u></a> <br /></p><p>Rather, they hadn't been culturally relevant till MasterChef Australia came along. We easily relate to the contestants because of their life stories, and then watch them encounter new techniques, face their challenges and surpass them with aplomb. Those of us who love desserts, for example, now have a very good idea about tempering chocolate, because the 'Dessert Queen' in every season pulls it off! </p><p>Here's our list of 5 techniques from MC Au that you must know about. All 5 were presented to us Wednesday night during the Star World's MasterChef Australia Gourmet Gala, New Delhi. Chef Sujan Sarkar and his team at Olive Bar and Kitchen cooked perfect platters of MC Au-inspired food using these 5 techniques:</p><p><b>Aerate</b><br />The MasterChef guide explains aeration as "the process by which air is circulated through, mixed with or dissolved in a substance similar to how cakes and breads are baked." Liquid batters, for example, are injected with air using a siphon gun. </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>This makes the batters very light, and the fries come out fluffy and crisp. It's a comparatively simple process, and the end results make for the best-ever crunchy snacks.</p><p><b>Sous Vide</b><br />This method needs care, and we have seen many MC Au contestants struggle with it over the last 7 seasons. Sous vide is the "method of cooking in which food is sealed in airtight plastic bags then placed in a water bath." All the flavours, like herbs and light spices, are put in the plastic bags along with the main protein ingredient (which can be fish, meat, chicken, etc). </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>The sealing and slow-poaching makes sure that the flavours get completely infused with the protein. This technique has French origins, and, like all culinary gems of that country, helps create delicious recipes.</p><p><b>Molecular</b><br />If you watch MC Au, you are already familiar with molecular gastronomy and its greatest proponent, Heston Blumenthal. Molecular is quite simply "the application of scientific principles to the understanding and development of food preparation", but it also messes with your head. </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>Remember the Heston special where he created (what looked like) a beautiful plate of eggs, bacon and toast, but turned out to be a balanced dessert? Chefs and cooks who use this process are quite like scientists in the kitchens, literally.</p><p><b>Roulade</b><br />A roulade is a "dish cooked or served in the form of a roll, typically made from a flat piece of meat, fish or sponge, spread with a soft filling and rolled up into a spiral." We're sure you've tasted Swiss rolls, but the way MC Au contestants and chefs all around the world use this method is more creative. </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>It can be used to transform the flavor, look and plating of savoury as well as sweet dishes. Try it with a chicken some time and you'll know exactly how amazing it tastes.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/masterchef-australia-season-8-may-2016-competitive-cooking-show-matt-preston-gary-mehigan-george-calombaris-india-usa-canada-mexico-uk/1/655134.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/masterchef-australia-season-8-may-2016-competitive-cooking-show-matt-preston-gary-mehigan-george-calombaris-india-usa-canada-mexico-uk/1/655134.html"><u><b>Also read: MasterChef Australia is back, and the food looks more gorgeous than ever! </b></u></a> <br /></p><p><b>Deconstruct</b><br />We've seen this done to pies, cheesecakes and sushi during the show. Deconstruction in food means "to take apart a traditional or well known dish and re-create it in a whole new way." It's important to give a cautionary note here: everything in food can ideally be deconstructed, but a cook has to realise what should be deconstructed and what shouldn't. </p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>When done with clarity and a deft hand, deconstructed dishes can be brilliant. But this technique also leads to some disastrous dishes when there's a lack of vision. </p><p>We know that not all of these techniques can be easily attempted in our home kitchens. Some of the equipment, like the sous vide machine, are quite expensive and tricky to handle. </p><p>But if you have a kitchen thermometer to keep the water bath stable, you can sous vide in a pot. You can buy a batch of gelatin and pectin and try out some molecular gastronomy. If you love food and are inspired to cook after watching MasterChef Australia, don't hesitate. 'Where there's a will there's a way' has never been more accurate!</p>]]></storybody>
