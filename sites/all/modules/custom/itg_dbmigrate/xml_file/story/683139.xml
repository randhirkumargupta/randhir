<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The Kashmir Valley may have witnessed numerous terror attacks in the last few months, but the Army has had the last laugh as it has eliminated several hardcore terror commanders recently.&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHANGE IN STRATEGY</b><br /></p><p>With a change in strategy, the security forces are now focusing on eliminating top terrorists in intelligence-based operations. Figures tell the story of army's changed tactic. Since January 2016, 52 terrorists have been neutralised and that includes names like Hizbul Mujahideen commander Ashiq Hussain Bhat and Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Abu Hafiz. Surrender of another Hizbul's most wanted terrorist Tariq Pandit, who was considered close to Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, came as a big catch.&nbsp;</p><p>List accessed by AajTak, clearly shows that how the Army is now focusing on eliminating the leadership of Jihadi Tanjeem's active in the valley. Sources said that out of the 15 top terror commanders who crossed the Line of Control and infiltrated into the Kashmir Valley this year, 10 are already dead.&nbsp;</p><p>The first batch of around 12 terrorists was reported to have sneaked into the Valley through Dardpora village located along the LoC on April 12. Six other militants were reported to have infiltrated from Lolab side around April 17. Enhanced focus on technical and human intelligence gathering and coordinated operations are yielding the desired results.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the international intelligence sharing is also helping in tracking the most wanted terrorists. Defence expert Major General (retired) RK Arora pointed out that intelligence sharing with US and Afghanistan along with better multi-agency inputs is helping troops to carry out successful operations.&nbsp;</p><p><b>ARMY PAYS THE PRICE AS WELL</b><br /></p><p>However, the Army has had to pay the price of the success as well. Over a dozen soldiers including officers and JCO's have died during counter-terror operations.&nbsp;</p><p>With the summer still setting in, infiltration attempts have seen a steady rise. All efforts are being made to strengthen the counter-insurgency grid, which is a conglomeration of Army, paramilitary and state police.&nbsp;</p><p>There were 121 infiltration attempts along the border in Jammu and Kashmir in 2015 of which 33 were successful. However, 46 terrorists were killed by security forces. In 2014, there were 222 infiltration attempts in the state of which 65 were successful. A total of 52 terrorists were killed by the security forces that year.</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mehbooba-mufti-hits-out-at-jammu-and-kashmir-separatists/1/682172.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mehbooba-mufti-hits-out-at-jammu-and-kashmir-separatists/1/682172.html">Also read: Mehbooba Mufti hits out at Jammu and Kashmir separatists</a></b> </p>]]></storybody>
