<storykicker><![CDATA[Inside the 7000 acre 'explosive zone' located within the CAD, the situation is now under control. However, clearing the affected area from unexploded ammunition and debris will take weeks, if not months.&nbsp;]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p><b>INDIA TODAY</b> has confirmed that the fire reported in one shed of the southern sector of the Central Ammunition Depot (CAD), Pulgaon which caused the explosion had an impact on at least nine more sheds in the vicinity. While the damage to these nine sheds is varied in nature, the response ensured the damage was limited and no further explosions took place despite the widespread impact. It was also reliably learnt that the original shed where the fire was detected has been completely smashed and will be rebuilt for usage. </p><p><b>DEBRIS WILL TAKE MONTHS TO CLEAR</b></p><p>Inside the 7000 acre 'explosive zone' located within the CAD, the situation is now under control. However, clearing the affected area from unexploded ammunition and debris will take weeks, if not months.&nbsp; </p><p>While it still isn't known what triggered the incident, the credit for containing it within the CAD is certainly due to inherent planning, drills perfected over the years and a little luck. The magnitude of the incident was such that those in charge did not rule out a mass evacuation situation, reaching even the outskirts of Nagpur which is located 120km away.&nbsp; </p><p>As the dust settles, inside the stricken-Central Ammunition Depot (CAD) at Pulgaon, a narrative is evolving. </p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cad-disaster-inside-mecca-of-ammunition-the-ground-still-shakes/1/683393.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cad-disaster-inside-mecca-of-ammunition-the-ground-still-shakes/1/683393.html">Inside 'Mecca of ammunition', the ground still shakes</a> </b><br /></p><p><b>MOMENTS BEFORE DISASTER UNFOLDED</b></p><p>Post midnight, upon receipt of information, Major K Manoj Kumar, CAD's Internal Security Officer (ISO) charged towards the location of the reported fire from his residence close to the main gate 'Shakti Dwar'. He was also the officer in-charge of the base's fire fighting units. He was followed by his neighbour and senior, Lieutenant Colonel RS Pawar, CAD's head of administration and the Deputy Commandant, Colonel Ghaninder Singh. All three had nearly completed their tenures and figured on the base's 'Posted Out' list. Major Pawar's replacement, a younger officer was in fact called a day in advance. He too reached the site. Within ten minutes of commencing their operation, a massive roar erupted, emitting shock waves and releasing mind-numbing amount energy in a relatively smaller region. Estimates say nearly 60,000 metric tonnes of explosives went up. Major Manoj, Lt Colonel Pawar and seventeen others did not survive this outburst. Three army gypsies, three fire fighting trucks, a water bowser and a private vehicle were blown away too.

</p><p>Many, even within the army, have wondered if these men should have waited instead of taking the situation head on. Responding to this, a source said, "A fire was reported and it had to be nipped in the bud before it caused an explosion. These officers led the operation but were unfortunately outpaced. We won't have anyone like them anymore."</p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pulgaon-blast-130-tonn-ammunition-gutted-down-sabotage-angle-being-investigated/1/683350.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pulgaon-blast-130-tonn-ammunition-gutted-down-sabotage-angle-being-investigated/1/683350.html"><u><font color="#0066cc"><b>Pulgaon: 130 Tonne ammunition gutted down, sabotage angle seriously investigated</b></font></u></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>MASSIVE EVACUATION WAS PLANNED</b></p><p>By the time the first explosion rocked the base, virtually everyone had reached the site. "Most of us were there by then. We have practiced the drill and that morning was the time to put it to use," said a source. Abundant water supply (30 million litres of water is available at all times), a well-spread network of fire sub stations and planning ensured that within a few hours, the assessment yielded positive news. The damage was contained within though peripheral villages also took a hit. </p><p>"In the early hours, based on our calculations, things could have gone drastically wrong. Our planning was to even evacuate population right up to Nagpur," said a senior officer. Outside the CAD, a civilian employee said, "This was the impact with anti tank mines detonating. Not too far is where we store shells for artillery guns. It is anybody's guess what would've happened." </p><p>A total of nineteen men and officers perished while seventeen were injured in the tackling the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>The neighbouring residences of Maj K Manoj Kumar and Lt Col Pawar wear a desolate look. Barring support staff, there was no one there. Said a colleague, "Not many know Major Manoj had joined the army as a jawan and then underwent rigorous examination to re-enter the army as an officer." A Defence Security Corps (DSC) jawan who had worked under K Manoj Kumar and Pawar said, "They knew this place so well. It was a pleasure to have people with such clarity."</p><p>All the three officers who mattered the most after the Commandant of CAD were consumed by the accident. As a result, juniors have been asked to take their place. New to their jobs, nothing but the best is required out of them and immediately so. "With such a loss, you can't possibly run the show but you can't possibly run away. All I can say is that the Commandant's is an unenviable position," said a veteran ordnance officer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><b><i>WRITER IS A SENIOR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND TWEETS @JRPUR</i></b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
