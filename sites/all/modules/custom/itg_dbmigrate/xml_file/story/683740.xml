<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) on Saturday cancelled the results of the two toppers of the Intermediate (Science) examinations, including Sourabh Shrestha, after they failed to prove their merit in a retest.</p><p><b>CLUELESS TOPPERS</b></p><p>Sourabh, who was declared the topper in the science stream earlier, and his college mate Rahul Kumar, were among the 13 toppers from the arts and science streams in the Class XII examinations who were asked by the board to reappear in a retest by the board on Friday following a controversy over their merit.</p><p>BSEB chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh said while 11 students who took the test passed the test, Sourabh and Rahul, both students of the controversial Vishun Rai College, flunked. "Their results have been cancelled," Singh said.</p><p>The BSEB also suspended the affiliation of the Vishun Rai College, Bhagwanpur in Vaishali district. Singh said a judicial inquiry headed by a retired high court judge would be set up to probe the alleged irregularities.</p><p>Meanwhile, the board decided to give a week's time to Ruby Rai, the arts topper, from the same college who had failed to take the retest on Friday on health grounds. Her results would also be cancelled if she does not appear in a retest to dispel the doubts raised over her merit.</p><p><b>POLITICAL SCIENCE=COOKERY SCIENCE</b></p><p>In a recent expose by the India Today TV, Ruby was shown referring to political science as 'prodigal science, a subject which was meant for teaching cookery to students'. </p><p>The science topper Sourabh had also failed to correctly answer simple questions in the same expose, raising a big question mark over the quality of school education in Bihar. </p><p>The BSEB had subsequently decided to call all the 14 students from the arts and science streams who had bagged the top five positions in the Class XII examinations held earlier this year. Vishun Rai College, an unaided college, has been in the news in the past few years for alleged irregularities. </p><p>Last year, the then education minister PK Shahi had withheld its results after receiving several complaints about it. This year, 97.52 per cent candidates from this college cleared the Intermediate science examination even though only 67.07 per cent students could clear the test in the state. </p><p>Out of the total 646 students who took the examination, 534 had obtained the first division marks</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-board-exam-toppers-retest-nitish-kumar-india-today-expose/1/683503.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-board-exam-toppers-retest-nitish-kumar-india-today-expose/1/683503.html">Also read: Bihar board exam 'toppers' under scanner to skip retest ordered by government?</a></b> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
