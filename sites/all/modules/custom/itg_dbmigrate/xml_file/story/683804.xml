<storykicker><![CDATA[Chef Jaydeep Mukherjee&nbsp;from Indigo Deli, Vasant Kunj&nbsp;writes&nbsp;on the what, how and why of Awadhi Cuisine.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The Nawabs have long gone, the remnant descendants, few and far between, have scattered. The pomp and the festivity has faded and the perpetual celebration of life and gastronomy in general does not hold centre stage in lives in the region anymore. The legacy of what they have left behind, however, is so thrilling, inspiring and amazing that many more volumes could be written about Awadhi lifestyle and cuisine, specifically. Kitchens were the size of playfields with teams of chefs and cooks that not just resembled but even worked like armies. <br /><br />Bawarchis, rakabdars, nanfus--all high up on the social ladder of culinary elite were assisted by lesser mortals like masalchis who were experts in grinding masalas, degbos who washed utensils and mehris who lugged trays, containers, utensils and the general paraphernalia that went into setting up state of the art cooking facilities.</p><p>The head rakabdars and bawarchis were semi royal themselves! They were paid as much as most ministers in the courts, often more! They had budgets that were bottomless when it came to cooking meals and acquired the best ingredients from various corners of the globe! They were fought over by the Nawabs and their protege and to have a particular clan cook your dastarkhwan was a matter of immense prestige.</p><p><b>Also Read:<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lifefd-masterchef-australia-season-8-speak-gourmet-gala-new-delhi-india-techniques-aerate-sous-vide-molecular-roulade-deconstruct-star-world-tv-series/1/683307.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lifefd-masterchef-australia-season-8-speak-gourmet-gala-new-delhi-india-techniques-aerate-sous-vide-molecular-roulade-deconstruct-star-world-tv-series/1/683307.html"> <u>5 tricky techniques from MasterChef Australia you ought to know</u></a> </b></p><p>The food was not just delicious, it was generally nutritious and procedures followed were scientific and extremely hygienic, transferred from masters to apprentices, through rote, not so much written instructions. Chef Mukhtar Qureshi, dear friend and Master Chef of Neel, one of the best restaurant serving Awadhi Cuisine in the country! is a man of few words outside his kitchen but what he does inside it can only be described as a combination of magic and intense theatre! The fragrance of drying herbs, roots, spices and flowers, the spluttering of charcoal in his specially treated tandoor, the fluid efficiency of his highly trained cooks, meats resting on racks and salias, in between stints in special temperature controlled ovens and jargon only his boys understand, greeted me as I strolled through his kitchen. Classic Awadhi fare for the better part. Shorbas, kebabs, biryanis, nihari, pasanda, qurmas, salans, khaliya, an array of nans, sheermals and bakhakhanis and then a sampling of the legendary parde me khubani and angoori rabdi! Some of the names were familiar. I had studied about the cuisine in hotel school, eaten classic dishes in some of the best restaurants across the country.</p><p>Here was revelation! Each thing I slurped, bit into, smelt, touched, tasted, dug into finally, didn't begin and end there! There were literally layers of aromas, visuals, tastes, flavours and textures! Some subtle, some outright noisy and bold but all held together by stunning expertise and in-depth knowledge of a centuries old cuisine and culture. Awadhi food, as has been portrayed generally across media and also on restaurant menus worldwide, is not about the Mughal influence in the region alone! The Hindu ways of Oudh or Ayodhya and the impact of many hundreds of years of British rule has left vivid marks on the gastronomy from the region in general.</p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/easy-meals-in-jars-5-ideas-workday-lunch-solution-eat-on-the-go-smoothies-salads-grains-lentils-roast-chciken-shrimps-veggies-pudding-layered/1/680946.html" target="_blank">Also Read: 5 easy and delicious dishes you can eat out of a jar on the go</a> </b> </p><p>The use of simple seasonal produce--vegetables and fruits, delicate cuts of meat, the varied ways of treating aquatic life, the refined use of excellent dairy, varied lentils and pulses and the myriad ways they're put to use in Awadhi cuisine is a pleasure to observe. Stocks or yakhnis to flavour biryanis and tehris. Shorbas or essences and broths of not just paya or trotters but of fruits and vegetables to start meals in the most eclectic ways. Slow cooking with dum ï¿½?? perhaps the best example of Slow cooking worldwide, all speak of an art form that was highly influenced by many elite cultures of the times and intensely evolved and orchestrated! Parallels can be drawn between much evolved French Cooking and Awadhi and in every respect this home grown cuisine, polished and refined over centuries, that has satiated gourmet kings, Nawabs and commons in equal measure, would emerge, without a doubt, on the pinnacle.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
