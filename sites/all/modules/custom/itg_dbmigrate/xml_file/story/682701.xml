<storybody><![CDATA[<p><i>"So many years have passed and I still miss my best friend. Wish we could stay in touch."</i></p><p>So, it's been a while since you and your friend had a fallout, and your ego clearly has been preventing you from talking to each other. *Are we right, or are we right?*</p><p>When someone means a lot to you, and then they choose to disappear, it obviously leaves quite a huge void in your life.</p><br /><iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/12Ka2Yhp1OckKI" mce_src="//giphy.com/embed/12Ka2Yhp1OckKI" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="192" width="480"></iframe><p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/obviously-i-have-that-stupid-song-from-the-new-annie-in-my-head-miss-best-friend-12Ka2Yhp1OckKI" mce_href="http://giphy.com/gifs/obviously-i-have-that-stupid-song-from-the-new-annie-in-my-head-miss-best-friend-12Ka2Yhp1OckKI"></a></p><p>So, you've been spending a bit of time wondering what he/she might be up to--or even gone on to stalk them on social media (if you haven't been blocked).</p><p>Why not just get back in touch and put an end to such ambiguity?</p><p>Now, we get it that ego is something that solely takes a few of your decisions. So, without hurting too much of it, we have devised ways for you to get back with your beloved friend. </p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jugaad-tricks-tips-ways-to-keep-cool-summer-cannot-afford-an-ac-air-conditioning-heat-house/1/680976.html"><u><b>Also read: 5 jugaads that will keep you cool this summer, if you cannot afford an AC </b></u></a> <br /></p><p>And trust us, it's going to be the best thing you will do today, or tomorrow, or next week. Food for thought, though: what if he/she is also thinking about doing the same?</p><p>Either way, here's how you can revive your friendship without really having to say the word 'sorry'.</p><p>                                 {funfacts}<div class="conclace-story-wrapper"><div class="dotted-line"></div><div class="conclace-heading"></div>
