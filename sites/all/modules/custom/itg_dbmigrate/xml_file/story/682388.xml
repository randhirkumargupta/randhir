<storykicker><![CDATA[<p>Let your kids try their hand at adult life--minus the pressure! <br /></p>]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Any adult entering KidZania is bound to experience a mish-mash of emotions, ranging from marvel, excitement and longing to a teeny-tiny twinge of jealousy.</p><p>How many of us have had the chance to spend time in a city built exclusively for kids, where we worked and handled our own finances? The closest we came to that was probably through board game like Business or Life or Monopoly. KidZania is a much more imaginative, real-life version of the same. Built around the concept of letting kids experience a slice of adult life (only the good bits), KidZania is an entire indoor city with paved roads, battery-operated vehicles, buildings, a fully functional economy with its own currency, and 27 real-world careers thrown in.<br /></p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>Once kids enter the city after passing through the immigration department, they collect their KidZania money and take on life the way they see their parents living every day. They can sign up to 'work' at any of the several careers on offer. From becoming a firefighter to put out a mock fire, to learning how to fly a plane, from working in a to working in a salon, kids get an opportunity to try their hand at 90 role-playing avatars. While they earn money for all of these services, they pay when they want to learn a skill like biscuit-manufacturing or learning how to cook (just like we all do in real life). <br /></p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/mothers-day-mom-tell-us-about-secret-lies-anjana-om-kashyap-sanghamitra-chakraborty/1/660761.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/mothers-day-mom-tell-us-about-secret-lies-anjana-om-kashyap-sanghamitra-chakraborty/1/660761.html"><u><b>Watch: 5 moms tell us about the lies they have told their kids</b></u></a> <br /></p><p>It's a great way to not only make kids realise the value of money, but the role-playing also lets them try on different professional hats, albeit, for some time.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>And the best part about it all? The kids have to make their choices and do all the activities independently, without any interference from adults. While adults can purchase a ticket to watch their kids engage in these activities and maybe click some pictures, that's the maximum leeway the place gives them, so it might be a good idea to carry a book and sip on a coffee while you're there, or better still go with another parent. There are various options for food (for adults and kids), such as a Dunkin' Donuts, Zebra Crossings and Dominos among others. <br /></p><p>Actor Shah Rukh Khan--who brought the franchise to India when he launched the first one in 2013 in Mumbai--also attended the launch of the Capital's KidZania, talking about his dream to bring the Mexican concept to the country for his kids. He said, "I am extremely excited to introduce the families of Delhi NCR to this unique edutainment concept. I remember being left in complete awe, the first time I experienced the role-playing activities at KidZania and became determined to bring this unique concept to the children in India. As a father, it gives me great pride to offer other families this wonderful opportunity to allow their children to learn the ways of the real world in a fun and exciting environment. Our priority is to create a safe and fun environment to introduce values such as financial literacy, responsibility and dignity of labour to children. Now we have 2 KidZania Centres in India and I commit to open the next one in South India."</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>The price points have been set according to the time spent in the city, and the age of the child, starting at Rs 300 for toddlers (0-4 years) and going up to Rs 1,150 (weekdays). Prices during the weekend increase but considering the mental stimulation, it's worth the money.</p><p><i>KidZania Delhi is situated in Entertainment City, near The Great India Place, Sector 38-A, Noida </i><br /></p>]]></storybody>
