<storybody><![CDATA[<p>King Tut seems to have wielded an uber-cool extraterrestrial weaponry in his afterlife.</p><p>This might sound surreal, but recent studies confirm that the dagger buried with Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun was made using iron from a meteorite. </p><p>The team of researchers from Milan Polytechnic, Pisa University and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo published their study on Tuesday in the<a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12664/full" mce_href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12664/full"> journal Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science.</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>The discovery of the cosmic dagger</b></p><p>The dagger was originally discovered in 1925, by archaeologist Howard Carter, just three years after the young pharaoh's tomb was unearthed. </p><p>Howard Carter found two daggers, one iron and one with blade of gold. The first one was surrounding the right thigh of King Tut's mummy, while the second gold blade was wrapped around his abdomen. </p><p>"The dagger has a finely manufactured blade, made of non-rusted, apparently homogeneous metal. Its handle is made of fine gold, is decorated with cloisonn√© and granulation work, and ends with a pommel of rock crystal. Its gold sheath is decorated with a floral lily motif on one side and with a feathers pattern on the other side, terminating with a jackal's head, " wrote the researchers. </p><p><br /><b>Iron of the sky</b></p><p>Since the discovery of the dagger, scientist were hesitant to study the most treasured artifact from King Tuts tomb, lest it gets damaged. But, with dramatic technological advancement, scientists dived in to study the metallic composition of the mysterious dagger. </p><p>Using non-invasive, portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, the team of researchers from Italy and Egypt cracked the composition. Results of the&nbsp; X-ray spectrometry revealed concentrations of nickel and cobalt in the dagger that were similar to the proportion in iron meteorite. </p><p>The researchers said the finding provided insight into the Egyptian's use of the term "iron of the sky".</p><p><b><br />Gifts from the heavens</b></p><p>Egyptians attributed great value to meteoritic iron. They revered objects that fell from the sky. </p><p>In the journal <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12664/full" mce_href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12664/full">Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science</a>  researchers wrote "most ancient Egyptian iron artifacts, i.e. nine small beads, excavated from a tomb in Gerzeh Egypt and dated about 3200 BCE are made of meteoritic iron, carefully hammered into thin sheets." </p><p>"The high manufacturing quality of Tutankhamun's dagger blade is evidence of early successful iron smithing in the 14th C. BCE."</p><p><b>The weapon is now on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. </b></p>]]></storybody>
