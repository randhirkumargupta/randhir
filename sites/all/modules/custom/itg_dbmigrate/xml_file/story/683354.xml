<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Pratapgarh Police on Thursday arrested seven persons for smuggling 102 calves from Tonk and seized two trucks, while one person and another truck could not apprehended.</p><p>Four dead calves were also recovered from the trucks. This angered a mob of cow protection activists which thrashed the smugglers, police said.</p><p>One person has been arrested and six other have been booked for assaulting two of the accused and stripping one in a parallel case registered against a mob, Pratapgarh SP Kaluram Rawat told India Today.</p><p>Three of the smugglers who were assaulted, have refused to lodge any FIRs and police has lodged a case on its own.</p><p>In Rajasthan, calves and cows can not be transported without necessary permissions and no such document has been provided by the smugglers yet. Pratapgarh police has sought information from Tonk to find out from where and how the animals were loaded.</p><p>According to Rawat, the information about three trucks loaded with calves was circulated on Whatsapp among activists on the lookout for such smugglers. The activists had also informed the police. While one truck was apprehended and four were arrested without any trouble, the second truck did not stop at a barrier and its driver tried to scare away the mob by driving close to them. </p><p>As police and activists continued their chase, four persons jumped and ran out of the truck. Two of these were caught and thrashed by one section of mob, another - the driver - was nabbed by others and stripped. The fourth one escaped.</p><p>The mob snowballed as devotees attending a religious sermon nearby also gathered on hearing about four dead calves. As the atmosphere became communally charged, the three men were immediately taken away to another town for their own safety and provided medical care.</p><p>The third truck, whose registration number is with the police, has not been found yet.</p><p>"So far, our investigations show that calves were being transported illegally but we are investigating it further. Also, it was an offence to attack the suspect and we expect to arrest six more accused for it and will look for others whose names will come up in their interrogation," Rawat said.</p><p>The activists seeking to prevent smuggling of calves have been active in the state, especially in Mewat region, but incidents of severe assaults on smugglers are rare. </p><p>Meos in the area, allege harassment in the hands of police, saying they are charged for transporting calves even for the state cattle fair. Police, however, insist that any such transportation should be supported by legal documents.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGuBzFNcnCk" mce_src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGuBzFNcnCk" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="364" width="647"></iframe></p>]]></storybody>
