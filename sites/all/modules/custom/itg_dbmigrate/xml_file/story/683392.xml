<storykicker><![CDATA[Graphic novelist Blake Leibel, known for the gory murder scenes in his comic books, has been charged with brutally murdering his girlfriend and draining her body of blood.<br /><br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Blake Leibel is a graphic novelist. He is from Canada and belongs to one of Toronto's wealthier families. But why are we talking about him? </p><p><b>A writer fascinated with gory details, Leibel has been accused of bringing the grisly acts of his comic books to life with the murder of his girlfriend, Iana Kasian.</b></p><p>Kasian, who had given birth to their son three weeks earlier, was found dead in their West Hollywood apartment last month, reports AP. But that wasn't it; <b>mangled and tortured, her body had been "drained" of blood.</b></p><p>Leibel has been charged with first-degree murder and could face the death penalty if convicted.</p><p><br /></p><h3>The bloodless corpse</h3><p>One of Leibel's critically-acclaimed graphic novels, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-canada-heir-lebeil-charged-murder-west-hollywood-20160531-snap-story.html" mce_href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-canada-heir-lebeil-charged-murder-west-hollywood-20160531-snap-story.html"><i>Syndrome</i></a>, had a scene where a <b>'serial killer hangs a couple from their ankles and slashes their throats, draining them of blood'</b>.</p><br /><blockquote data-twitter-extracted-i1464923876801863155="true" data-twitter-extracted-i1464923842529816965="true" class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">SYNDROME: A Graphic Novel. HCDJ 1ST, 2010. Created by Blake Leibel <a href="https://t.co/rRbkgVKsJ5" mce_href="https://t.co/rRbkgVKsJ5">https://t.co/rRbkgVKsJ5</a> <a href="https://t.co/GkZk1y6H3t" mce_href="https://t.co/GkZk1y6H3t">pic.twitter.com/GkZk1y6H3t</a></p>ï¿½?? bid elegant items (@elegant_items) <a href="https://twitter.com/elegant_items/status/731671230747643907" mce_href="https://twitter.com/elegant_items/status/731671230747643907">May 15, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" mce_src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br /><p>Earlier, Leibel described Syndrome as a novel "that grappled with the questions surrounding what provokes a person to commit evil acts."</p><p>Kasian had moved out of their apartment apartment earlier in May after Leibel was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. Later, she had gone back to the house to talk things out and never returned.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-canada-heir-lebeil-charged-murder-west-hollywood-20160531-snap-story.html" mce_href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-canada-heir-lebeil-charged-murder-west-hollywood-20160531-snap-story.html">LA Times reports</a>  that after Kasian's mother reached out to the police with a missing complaint, officers visited Leibel's apartment to find the door jammed shut with furniture and bedding. To top that, Leibel stood out as "agitated and uncooperative".</p><p><b>However, the scene beyond the door was much worse.</b></p><p>Kasian's mangled body was found in the bedroom; she had "sustained blunt force trauma to her head" and was lying in a bloodless state. </p><p><br /></p><h3>How can blood be drained from a body?</h3><p>Certified Medical Illustrator Michael Konomos writes in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-it-take-to-drain-a-body-of-blood" mce_href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-it-take-to-drain-a-body-of-blood">Quora</a>  that in case of "organ donor procedures", the aorta is cut open; the blood then fills the abdomen, from where it is suctioned out.</p><p>In case of wound, Konomos says it "depends on the severity of the wound." "Every bit of blood is not going to drain out unless it is somehow flushed out using another fluid. But enough will drain out for the person to die of course," he adds.</p><p><b>Exsanguination is the process of blood loss that results in death.</b> It depends on a person's age, health and fitness level as to how much bleeding can cause it.</p><p>Usually, people can die from losing half or two-thirds of their blood volume. A single deep cut into a major artery or vein can lead to exsanguination if not treated properly.</p>]]></storybody>
