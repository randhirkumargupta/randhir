<storykicker><![CDATA[Sajid and Farhad have stepped into the shoes of Sajid Khan to deliver another bone-tickling comedy, Housefull 3.&nbsp; And the director duo talks to IndiaToday.in about the film, critics and the camaraderie between the actors.&nbsp; ]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>They have written the lyrics for some of the most popular songs of the last decade, they have made actors mouth the funniest of lines that had fans in splits, and now, lyricists-turned-scriptwriters-turned-filmmakers duo is ready to entertain the audience with their second film after the 2014 Entertainment. Sajid and Farhad have stepped into the shoes of Sajid Khan to deliver another bone-tickling comedy, Housefull 3. &nbsp;</p><p><u><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/see-pic-when-akshay-kumar-and-housefull-3-gang-gatecrashed-asins-home-in-delhi/1/676903.html">ALSO READ: When Akshay Kumar and Housefull 3 gang gatecrashed Asin's home in Delhi </a></b></u></p><p><u><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/housefull-3-abhishek-bachchan-has-a-great-comic-timing-says-co-actor-riteish-deshmukh/1/675389.html">ALSO READ: Abhishek Bachchan has great comic timing, says co-actor Riteish Deshmukh </a></b></u> <br /></p><p>While the first two instalments of the franchise have been hits at the box office, critics have never been too kind to Housefull. Often tagged as mindless masala films, the Housefull franchise isn't exactly in the good books of critics. But the filmmaker duo is more concerned about the aam janta than critics.</p><p>"With due respect to everyone, critics are very important to us. Whether they reject or appreciate our films, their verdict is important to us. But if the janta is happy, then that is the ultimate high. We make films for public and not for the critics. The box office is very important for films like Housefull because they are commercial and big budget films. But if we get good numbers along with good ratings, then it would be the icing on the cake," say Sajid and Farhad in a conversation with IndiaToday.in. </p><p>But at the same time, the duo has requested the critics to start taking comedy films seriously and not treat them as frivolous films. "Making a comedy film is a serious business. Most of the critics don't take comic films seriously, then don't give good ratings to films in this genre. But if it is a rone-dhone ki film, they will say 'ye toh kamaal ki film hai'. We don't understand when they say it is different cinema. Cinema is cinema and the basic format is entertainment," they add.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TlZM9kuqw38" mce_src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TlZM9kuqw38" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="445"></iframe></p><p>Comedy isn't a new genre for the duo. In fact, the two aren't new to the Housefull franchise either. After penning the dialogues for Housefull 2, producer Sajid Nadiadwala asked Sajid-Farhad to direct the third instalment.</p><p>"When we were doing Entertainment, we were called by Sajid Nadiadwala and he offered us the third instalment of the franchise. He told us, 'Main chahta hoon aap log direct karo. You are the first choice because you had written Housefull 2, so you know the soul of the film.' And we told him that Housefull is Sajid Khan's film and he said no, he is not doing it this time and the third film has to be directed by someone else. So when it was offered to us on a platter, we decided to grab the opportunity with both our hands," say Sajid-Farhad. </p><p>But the announcement of Housefull 3 sans Sajid Khan set tongues wagging. From a tiff between Nadiadwala and Khan to Sajid-Farhad stealing the third instalment from Sajid, many rumours started doing the rounds. But the director duo quips, "Assumptions se hi toh masala aata hai."</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p>However, on a more serious note the two clarify, "It was already clear between Khan and Nadiadwala that Housefull 3 will be directed by someone else. So there was nothing like hamari wajah se ye film Sajid Khan direct nahi kar raha. It was all sorted since the beginning of the film."</p><p>While Sajid and Farhad have worked with Akshay Kumar in their directorial debut Entertainment, for the two, it was an equally enriching experience to direct Riteish Deshmukh and Abhishek Bachchan. "Riteish has a fantastic comic timing and Abhishek is also superb when he gets into the character. If you have seen and loved Bol Bachchan, you'll find wahi performance and wahi maza in Housefull 3. Abhishek is that great and funny in this film too. And we feel the chemistry between the three actors is going to be ultimate. Because they are best of friends off screen as well. In Housefull 3, the script is so brilliant and the characters are so interesting that we feel that it will be a paisa-vasool film," signs off the duo.</p>]]></storybody>
