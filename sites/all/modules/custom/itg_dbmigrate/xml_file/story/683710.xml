<storykicker><![CDATA[Rebel leader Ramvriksh Yadav had established an entire city inside Jawahar Bagh in Mathura with flour mills, ration depots, vegetable markets, salons and beauty parlours and more.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Spread in 280 acres, Jawahar Bagh in Mathura was not just a random case of encroachment, but it had all the signs of a personal fiefdom of the rebel leader Ramvriksh Yadav, who had established an entire city inside the property with flour mills, ration depots, vegetable markets, salons and beauty parlours and more.</p><p><b>'SATYAGRAHIS' POSSESSED EVERYTHING </b><br /></p><p>The so-called poor, homeless 'Satyagrahis' possessed everything from motorbikes, scooters and luxury automobiles. When the power was disconnected by the Mathura administration, they had even purchased numerous solar power systems that were used to power anything from televisions to fans and coolers inside the innumerable shacks that were spread out on the property.</p><p><b>'INDEPENDENT INDIAN GOVERNMENT' </b><br /></p><p>A common man may have difficulty in obtaining a cooking gas connection, but these straw shacks had gas cylinders in plenty and so was every other luxury they required. Water supply was from the horticulture department tubewells and trucks brought in everything that was required, including the stuff that was later sold off as 'ration' by Ramvriksh Yadav, who claimed to be running an 'Independent Indian Government' and took strolls through the area surrounded by armed guards.</p><p><b>RAMVRIKSH YADAV DEAD OR ALIVE?</b> <br /></p><p>Local administration claims that Yadav got burnt in the fire set off by his followers and probably died in the same, but there has been no official confirmation and teams have been setup to search for him, in case he had escaped and was living in some neighbouring district around Mathura. It is also being indicated that he may have returned to his native town Ghazipur. There are several bodies that are yet to identified.</p><p>Three injured rioters, including one identified as Mahesh of Siddharth Nagar, died in SN Medical College Agra today. The other two remain unidentified. The arrested rioters have been shifted from Mathura to Aligarh, Agra, Etah and Firozabad jails, while kids have been sent to Juvenile correction centers and women to the women shelter in Mathura.</p><p><b>POLITICAL BLAME GAME OVER DEAD</b><br /></p><p>Talking to India Today, Raisuddin said that the BJP is playing politics over dead bodies, which was the lowest it could descend in such a time of strife. The Samajwadi Party denounces any attempts by the BJP to make it a political issue.</p><p>Agra divisional commissioner Pradeep Bhatnagar said that the situation is presently under control and the administration is keeping a strict watch on the movements of everyone who had been connected to the Jawahar Bagh squatters and an inquiry was being instituted to ascertain the reasons behind such a disaster.</p><p><b>ALSO READ</b>:&nbsp; </p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-violence-up-cops-abandoned-sp-dwivedi-sho-yadav-to-save-their-own-lives/1/683706.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mathura-violence-up-cops-abandoned-sp-dwivedi-sho-yadav-to-save-their-own-lives/1/683706.html">Mathura violence: UP cops abandoned SP Dwivedi, SHO Yadav to save their own lives</a></b>  <br /></p>]]></storybody>
