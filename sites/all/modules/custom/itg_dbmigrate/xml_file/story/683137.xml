<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Uttar Pradesh Police may not register a case against the family of Mohammed Akhlaq- who was lynched by a mob last year over rumours that he butchered a cow- despite a forensic report saying meat recovered from the spot was beef.&nbsp;</p><p>The findings of a Mathura lab have whipped up a fresh political storm over the issue that fuelled a fierce debate on freedom of choice and religious intolerance in India.&nbsp;</p><p>In several Indian states, including Uttar Pradesh, the killing of cows and selling of beef are either restricted or banned as the animal is revered by many Hindus. However, local police said on Wednesday there is no evidence to suggest that Akhlaq's family was responsible for cow slaughter.</p><p><b>NO EVIDENCE AGAINST AKHLAQ'S FAMILY</b> <br /></p><p>"People might demand that a case should be registered. But as of now no criminal offence is made out as the beef was not found inside Akhlaq's house," said a senior officer.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was dumped in garbage nearby."&nbsp;</p><p>The 52-year-old resident of Bisada village in Dadri area on the outskirts of Delhi was beaten to death in September by an angry mob that suspected he had slaughtered a calf and eaten its meat.</p><p>While there were reports that the meat which was tested was found in Akhlaq's fridge, investigators are convinced that it was recovered from a&nbsp;garbage dump and do not rule out a "larger conspiracy".</p><p>A preliminary inquiry by the state's veterinary department had said it was goat meat.&nbsp;</p><p><b>'FIR WILL BE AGAINST UNKNOWN PEOPLE' </b><br /></p><p>"If at all an FIR is registered it will be against unknown people. It's not known who was involved in the cow slaughter. All aspects need to be looked at," the police officer added.&nbsp;</p><p>After the fresh forensic report surfaced this week, relatives of those arrested for allegedly killing Akhlaq have been demanding that an FIR be registered against his family and the compensation given by the state government be withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><p>The case has led to a political slugfest with BJP leaders from Uttar Pradesh targeting the ruling Samajwadi Party as chief minister Akhilesh Yadav questioned the authenticity of the forensic report.&nbsp;</p><p>State director general of Police Javed Ahmed told MAIL TODAY that the matter is in court and people should not jump to any conclusions.</p><p>"The meat found is tested as beef but whether it was found in Akhlaq's house has still not been established," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><b>'EVERY EYE ON THIS CASE' </b><br /></p><p>With political parties jumping in and the sensitive subject getting a communal colour, police are keeping a close eye on the developments. With UP headed for crucial assembly polls next year, firebrand BJP MP Yogi Adityanath hit out at the SP for questioning the report, alleging that the ruling party only wants votes and demanding registration of a cow slaughter case against Akhlaq's family.&nbsp;</p><p>The chief minister said nothing objectionable was found at Akhlaq's house. "Every eye is on this matter. Everyone wants that the victim's family should get justice as a murder took place," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-the-meat-in-victims-house-was-beef-says-forensic-report/1/682162.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dadri-lynching-the-meat-in-victims-house-was-beef-says-forensic-report/1/682162.html">Also read: Dadri lynching: The meat in victim's house was beef, says forensic report </a></b> </p>]]></storybody>
