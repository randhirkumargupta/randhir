<storykicker><![CDATA[Boxing legend Muhammad Ali's 1975 fight with Chuck Wepner was the inspiration behind Sylvester Stallone's Oscar-winning film, Rocky.<br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood megastar Sylvester Stallone's 1976 film Rocky told the rags to riches story of an underdog boxer, Rocky Balboa, who gets the chance of a lifetime to fight against the reigning heavyweight champion of the world. (<b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/muhammad-ali-dead-at-74-ali-arizona-hospital/1/683627.html">Muhammad Ali, who riveted the world as 'The Greatest,' dies</a></b>)<br /></p><p>The film turned out to be a critical and commercial success, earning over $225 million worldwide, and went on to win three Oscars, including the Best Picture.</p><p>Sylvester Stallone's career skyrocketed after that film and he turned into a star overnight. He wrote and starred in six more sequels which have since collectively grossed more than USD 1 billion at the worldwide box office. (<b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/muhammad-ali-cassius-clay-joe-frazier-george-foreman-boxing/1/683651.html">A fight-by-fight look at Muhammad Ali's career milestones</a></b>)<br /></p><p>Stallone's inspiration for the Rocky series came from the 1975 title fight between then world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali and world ranked contender Chuck Wepner. Wepner had knocked Ali off his feet in the ninth round. The fight went on for fifteen rounds and Ali was declared the winner through a technical knockout. (<b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/muhammad-ali-cassius-clay-louisville-the-greatest-boxing/1/683690.html">How Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali - The Greatest</a></b>)</p><p>In Stallone's film, Apollo Creed's character was based on Ali and Wepner was played by Rocky. Ali, who was made to look like the anti-hero in the film, wasn' t too impressed with the final outcome of the movie.</p><p>So much so that he took a dig at Stallone after watching the film and was quoted as saying, " I have been so great in boxing they had to create an image like Rocky, a white image on the screen, to counteract my image in the ring. America has to have its white images, no matter where it gets them. Jesus, Wonder Woman, Tarzan and Rocky."</p><p><b>ALI AND ROCKY EXCHANGE BLOWS</b></p><p>Ali though later claimed that he really liked the first Rocky and had made peace with the way he was portrayed on screen.
