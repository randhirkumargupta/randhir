<storykicker><![CDATA[Arts topper Ruby Rai's family members on Friday submitted an application to the Chairman of the Bihar School Examination Board, Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh, seeking exemption from the exams on health grounds.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>In an unprecedented move, 13 Bihar toppers appeared for re-examination to secure their position as toppers barring Ruby Rai, the Arts topper who opted to skip the examination. The Bihar School Examination Board had convened re-examination of Science and Arts stream toppers on Friday after an India Today expose showed how the toppers of Arts and Science, Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shrestha, respectively, were clueless about their subjects in which they had topped.</p><p>Ruby Rai's family members who on Thursday had expressed inability of Ruby appearing for re-examination on Friday submitted an application to the Chairman of the Bihar School Examination Board, Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh seeking exemption from the exams on health grounds. The Deputy Director, Nand Kishore Yadav of Bishun Rai College of which Ruby and Saurabh are students said that post the expose, Ruby was depressed and her mental condition was not fit to undertake the examination.</p><p>Nand Kishore Yadav said, "Ruby is undergoing treatment outside Bihar as she is mentally depressed. We have given application to the Board that Ruby would appear in examination only after she is healthy".</p><p>On the other hand, 13 toppers including Saurabh Shrestha appeared for the examination which lasted almost six hours during which two students at a time were interviewed by the team of 15 expert professors and teachers separately. </p><p>According to information with India Today, the students were asked 25 questions each relating to their stream and also asked to write a small paragraph to cross check their handwriting with the handwriting in the answer sheets. The Chairman of the Board said that once the re-examination was over, the Board would be sending the report of their finding to the Bihar govt for further action.</p><iframe src="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/embed/is7rx4pppc" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="396" width="648"></iframe>

<p>"Experts from Patna and Magadh University have been called to examine the toppers. Once the exams are over, we&nbsp; will send our report to the state govt", said Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh.</p><p>As the toppers got over with their re-examination, their hurriedly rushed out of the Board office premises to escape the media. Saurabh Shrestha, the Science topper along with his father Ajay Singh too tried to make his way outside the Board campus but the media chased him with flurry of questions.</p><p>An embarrassed Saurabh, however, said that his re-examination had gone well and truth would be out soon.</p><p>"My re-examination had gone well. The truth will be out soon", said Saurabh. &nbsp;</p><p>As a red faced Bihar govt conducted re-examination as a damage control after India Today's expose, all eyes are on the finding of the re-examination and also what will be the next move of the Bihar govt as far as Ruby Rai is concerned, whether she would be given another chance to appear for the exams or whether the govt chooses to cancel her result. The question is also whether the State govt will act on Bishun Rai college which had earned the dubious distinction of producing topper for last one decade repeatedly. </p><p><b>ALSO READ</b>:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-toppers-unsure-to-sit-for-re-exam-after-india-today-expose/1/683361.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-toppers-unsure-to-sit-for-re-exam-after-india-today-expose/1/683361.html"> <b>Clueless Bihar toppers unsure to sit for re-exam after India Today expose</b></a> <br /></p>]]></storybody>
