<storybody><![CDATA[<p>It's widely acknowledged that BJP's massive victory in the recently concluded Assam Assembly polls would not have been possible without the strategic expertise of former Congressman Himanta Biswa Sarma. He was the chief architect of three consecutive Congress victories in the state. But when he had a serious political rift with his former mentor Tarun Gogoi and sought intervention of Congress high command, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi ignored his appeal. The Gandhi scion firmly backed Gogoi and rejected Sarma's last appeal to make him, at least, Assam Congress chief. When Rahul finally met Sarma, he gave his dog more attention than Sarma, alleges the now BJP strongman in Assam.</p><p>Late last year, dissident Congress MLAs of Arunachal Pradesh camped in Delhi for nearly two hours to get an audience from Rahul Gandhi. But the Congress vice-president ignored them advising them to sort out their differences by consulting the general secretary in-charge. The disgruntled MLAs eventually toppled their own government and formed another with help of rival BJP. Almost the same story was replicated in Uttarakhand, but the intervention of Supreme Court saved the day for the Congress.</p><p><b>CHHATTISGARH CRISIS </b><br /></p><p>In all three cases, there is a common thread-Rahul Gandhi's reluctance to meet party leaders with grievances. All three states were Congress stronghold, it has lost two and the third one is a struggle for survival. Now another top leader has threatened to leave Congress with the same set of allegations. Ajit Jogi, Congress stalwart from Chhattisgarh has drawn another animal parallel about Congress high command. If Sarma found Rahul more interested in his dog, according to Jogi, speaking to Congress is like reading a book to a buffalo. Ajit Jogi had been doing rounds of Delhi to get his son Amit's expulsion from the party revoked but was not given an appointment by Rahul Gandhi. Amit was dismissed from the party when a newspaper report published a tape featuring him and Ajit Jogi fixing the Antagarh by poll.</p><p><b>JOGI TO FLOAT NEW PARTY</b> <br /></p><p>The electoral success of Jogi, who is planning to float a new party, is debatable but his defection will certainly cause a huge damage to Congress fortune in the state. The anti-incumbency against the BJP government headed by Raman Singh is too high and the victory margin in last Assembly polls in 2013 was too close for comfort. BJP won 49 seats as against Congress's 39 seats but both parties almost had identical vote share-BJP 41.04 per cent and Congress 40.29 per cent.</p><p>A united and rejuvenated Congress will certainly pose a serious challenge to the BJP in 2018 assembly polls. If Jogi breaks away, he would need the support of 12 Congress MLAs to form a new party. Though the political scenario is still very vague, the former Chhattisgarh CM may have the numbers. He also commands strong support from Satnami community, which is around 12 per cent of the electorate.</p><p>The Congress vice president may have his reasons to avoid meeting Jogi but he must now ensure that the damage caused by Jogi's departure is minimized. And he has two years to do that.</p><p><b>ALSO READ: <a target="_blank" href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/o-bhains-ajit-jogi-says-speaking-to-congress-is-like-reading-a-book-to-a-buffalo/1/683495.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/o-bhains-ajit-jogi-says-speaking-to-congress-is-like-reading-a-book-to-a-buffalo/1/683495.html">O bhains: Ajit Jogi says speaking to Congress is like reading a book to a buffalo</a></b><br /></p>]]></storybody>
