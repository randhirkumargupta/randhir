<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The Bihar School Examination Board today cancelled the results of Science stream toppers, Saurabh Shrestha and Rahul Kumar, after they failed in the re-examination that was conducted yesterday.</p><p>The board also cancelled the results of Science topper Rahul Kumar who too failed to clear the re-examination.</p><p>Issuing a press note within 24 hours of conducting the exam, chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh said that the board had cancelled the results of Saurabh and Rahul since they failed to impress the expert panels with their answers.</p><p>"It was found that the performance of Saurabh and Rahul were not up to the mark and thereby their results have now been cancelled", Lalkeshwar Singh said.</p><p>Ruby Rai, the Arts topper who skipped the re-examination, has been given another chance to appear for the re-examination on June 11. Ruby informed the board that she was suffering from depression and was mentally not in a position to re-appear for the exam.</p><p><b>ACTION AGAINST BISHUN RAI COLLEGE</b></p><p>Taking strict action against Bishun Rai College from where Saurabh and Ruby had topped the exams, the board suspended its registration till further orders.</p><p>It may be noted toppers in last one decade have always been from this college and this has now led to doubts over the manner in which it has been operating. Incidentally, the owner of the college Baccha Rai is believed to have close links with the RJD.</p><p>The board also announced the formation of a three-member high level committee, to be led by a retired High Court judge and two other members - a retired IAS or IPS officer and one retired former Vice Chancellor of a University - to investigate the case.</p><p>"We have set up a three-member committee to find out how Saurabh and Rahul managed to top the exams," Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh said.</p><p>The series of developments came after an India Today expose showed how the toppers of Arts and Science, Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shrestha, respectively, were clueless about simple questions despite being a topper. </p><p><b>Also read: <a target="_blank" href=" http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-arts-topper-ruby-rai-skips-re-examination-on-health-grounds/1/683587.html">Bihar topper, who said political science is about cooking, skips re-examination</a></b> </p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
