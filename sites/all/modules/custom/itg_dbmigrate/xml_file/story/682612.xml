<storykicker><![CDATA[A&nbsp;sting operation by India Today has revealed that Khadse left no stones unturned to intimidate and silence whistleblower Hemant Gawande<b>, </b>who had red-flagged the land grabbing by the minister.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>From alleged phone calls from India's most wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim to misuse of his position to benefit his family, Maharashtra Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse is in a whirlpool of controversy. A sting operation conducted by India Today has now nailed the minister further.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />It's the land scam controversy that has cornered the minister beyond anything else. Khadse has denied any wrongdoings. </p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-today-impact-heat-on-khadse-as-mumbai-police-launch-fresh-probe-into-dawood-calls/1/676011.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-today-impact-heat-on-khadse-as-mumbai-police-launch-fresh-probe-into-dawood-calls/1/676011.html"><u><font color="#0066cc"><b>India Today Impact: Heat on Khadse as Mumbai Police launch fresh probe into Dawood calls</b></font></u></a><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p><p>However, a sting operation by India Today has revealed that Khadse left no stones unturned to intimidate and silence <b>whistleblower Hemant Gawande, </b>who had red-flagged the land grabbing by the senior Maharashtra minister. <br /><b></b></p><p><b>KHADSE'S 'SARKAR RAAJ' EXPOSED</b></p><p>Gawande has furnished a page he says is from the Pune police dairy which mentions that a police inspector had been pressurised by Khadse to register a case against the whistleblower.</p><p>Since a piece of unverified paper couldn't be conclusive, India Today met the police officer - <b>Hiraman Shirsaat</b>, who had made the note against the Maharashtra minister. </p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/show-proofs-and-i-will-quit-politics-eknath-khadse/1/679462.html " target="_blank">Show proofs against me and I will quit politics: Eknath Khadse</a> </b><br /></p><p><b><i>Here's how the conversations went:</i></b> </p><p><b>India Today (IT):</b> We wanted to verify this note from the station diary. We accessed this through RTI, want to verify it as we don't want our report to be incorrect.</p><p><b>Shirsaat:</b> This is correct. </p><p><b>IT</b>: It says case was registered at the behest of Eknath Khadse.</p><p><b>Shirsaat</b>: What's written is correct. It has my signature.</p><p><b>IT:</b> Have seen such a police officer for the first time, who is writing against his minister....</p><p><b>Shirsaat:</b> Why should I be scared? I'll stay in jail...</p><p><b>IT:</b> But...can a minister pressurise anyone like this?</p><p><b>Shirsaat:</b> I wrote whatever he told me. </p><p><b>IT</b>: We are from India Today, sir.</p><p><b>Shirsaat:</b> That's okay. What he told me, I wrote it down and gave it to all departments in writing that he&nbsp; asked me to file a police complaint, please give me the details. The truth is there in it, nothing else.</p><p>Shirsaat claimed that minister Khadse summoned all police officers to a guest house in Pune and then pressurised them to take action against the whistleblower but he refused to oblige.</p><p>Minister Khadse allegedly flew into a rage threatening to take the case into his own hands and get the agricultural department involved. </p><p><b>SOLID CASE AGAINST KHADSE</b> </p><p>India Today reporters then asked the cop about the land grab allegation against Khadse. Inspector Shirsaat backed the whistleblower saying he has a solid case against the minister.</p><p><b>IT:</b> What about the land grab issue... the minister usurped 3.5 acre land...is this true?</p><p><b>Shirsaat:</b> Hemant Gawande should know this better...Gawande won't shout without any firm evidence...he is a coward. I tried to make him speak for nearly a year...now he has papers, that's why he is speaking else who would raise voice against a minister?</p><p>However, the Pune Police did in fact register a case against Hemant Gawande on 31 January last year finding nothing so far against the whistleblower.</p><p>The question now is can minister Khadse survive this fresh charge of misusing power to silence an inconvenient voice?</p><p><b>Also Read:</b></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dawood-khadse-call-link-vadodra-hacker-manish-bhangale-files-pil-against-eknath-khadse/1/679974.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dawood-khadse-call-link-vadodra-hacker-manish-bhangale-files-pil-against-eknath-khadse/1/679974.html">Dawood-Khadse call link: Vadodara hacker Manish Bhangale files PIL against Eknath Khadse</a> </b><br /></p><p><b><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kadse-admits-meeting-land-owner-before-his-wife-and-son-in-law-purchased-the-land/1/681004.html " target="_blank">Khadse admits meeting land owner before his wife and son-in-law purchased the land</a> </b><br /></p><iframe width="648" height="396" src="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/embed/is7rxazilc" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
