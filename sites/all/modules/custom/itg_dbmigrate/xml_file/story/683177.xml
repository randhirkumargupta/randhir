<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Ditching the rush and delving deep, an intrepid group of travellers are looking at holidays which they can enjoy at their own pace--preferably slow! The new-age traveller is increasingly looking for places that are remote or can be explored on foot, or may be on a bicycle.</p><p>"The speed of travel has shifted gears and has become slow. People prefer train journeys over flights to explore a destination from up-close," says Nikhil Ganju, Country Manager, TripAdvisor. In addition to this, they also want to do things just like a local would do so that they get to live the moment and not just experience it from a distance.</p><p><b>LIVING IT UP </b><br />Travel is changing and so is the traveller. The concept of travel as quick escape from city life is slowly dissolving. And what we see coming up is the idea of a meaningful experience that stays even after the holiday is over.</p><p>So instead of a typical "2nights/3days" break, you plan for a longer stay that allows you a plenty of time to rest and recharge inside out. "Travel has always been a mind-opening experience, and slow travel captures this very essence of travel," says Ratna Chadha, Chief Executive at Tirun Travel Marketing.</p><p><b>Also read: <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/three-of-the-remotest-villages-in-himachal-pradesh-you-can-visit-this-summer-kaza-chitkul-sangla-dhankar-shimla/1/652629.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/three-of-the-remotest-villages-in-himachal-pradesh-you-can-visit-this-summer-kaza-chitkul-sangla-dhankar-shimla/1/652629.html">Three of the remotest villages in Himachal Pradesh you can visit this summer</a></b>  <br /></p><p>The desire to do something different--something that you do not get to do in your everyday life--is the common trigger. "In the age of acceleration, slow travel allows people to not just relax and recharge, it also lets them enjoy the moment. You usually do not get to do that in the city where you are always rushing from one task to the other," says Kapil Goswamy, Managing Director and Founder, Big Breaks.</p><p>A holiday tastes deliciously better when you have the time to haul at the local joints and eat what the locals relish.<br /><b><br />UNPLUG &amp; UNWIND </b><br />Call it the digital detox or endeavour to break away from madding crowd of the city, people are also drifting away from the "over-theweekend" vacation, where the vacation is over before you even know it. "These are the more evolved travellers, who like spending more time to see things that are out of the ordinary," says Chadha. You stay at a place for a longer period, which gives you ample space for mindful movement. For many, slow travel is also about ditching luxury and staying at a place with no frills. A far cry from the multi-tasking world, idling on holiday becomes the must-do thing. The freedom to do as you like or doing nothing at all makes the whole experience all the more alluring.</p><p>Unplugging is another charm that is attracting travelers across the world to this trend. Many find it amazingly calming! The zero connectivity serves as a great temptation to simply unplug and unwind amidst the wilderness.</p><p><b>DOING THE DIFFERENT </b><br />When it comes to slow travel, the options are aplenty. You can add or subtract luxury from it. For some it could be checking into a skiing resort in Kashmir and spending days reading, while for others it could be staying at an all-basic monastery in Himachal Pradesh and practice meditation. From fishing to hiking, boat rides to long train journeys, health retreats to skiing resorts and escaping to solitude of the mountains to pedalling around a small city, you can simply pick and customise the travel as per your taste and comfort.</p><p>Whether you decide to travel by train or a bicycle ride, the relaxed movement of your travel makes for an enriching and meaningful holiday experience. In a way, slow travel is fast emerging as the antidote of the rat races that most of us are running in the city. Of all things, it helps you sip from the cup of life--fresh and hot--exactly the way you want. And that is exactly what the city dwellers used to fast lifestyle seem to be seeking nowadays.<br /></p>]]></storybody>
