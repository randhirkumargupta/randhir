<storykicker><![CDATA[Yusuf Pathan made a dramatic debut for Abahani Limited in the Dhaka Premier League, smashing a match-winning 47-ball 60.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2007 at the inaugural World T20, dashing opener Virender Sehwag injured himself ahead of the big final clash against arch-rivals Pakistan. That paved the way for a 24-year-old right-handed batsman to make his debut at the biggest stage possible. </p><p>What does Yusuf Pathan do in such a high-pressure game? He smashes Mohammad Asif for a towering six to open his account in international cricket. Pathan's six was the perfect pilot to what was a spectacular final filled with a series of high-octane moments.</p><p><b>PATHAN FALLS PREY TO DHAKA TRAFFIC<br /></b></p><p>Cut to 2016, Pathan has made another dramatic debut, this time for Abahani Limited in Bangladesh 50-over tournament- Dhaka Premier League. But there were some anxious moments for the Baroda cricketer as he nearly failed to play his first match for the Bangladesh franchise. </p><p>The India all-rounder was 40 minutes late to the match after he got stuck in traffic at Dhaka-Savar highway. He was given the nod to play after the match officials and the opposition decided in his favour. </p><p><b>MATCH-WINNING KNOCK </b><br /></p><p>However,&nbsp; the pre-match stutter didn't stop him from smashing a 47-ball 60 in a match-winning cause against Prime Bank Cricket Club. The Kolkata Knight Riders all-rounder capped his Indian Premier League form smashing seven boundaries and two sixes in the knock that steered his team out of danger. </p><p><b>'HAPPY I HAVE PERFORMED' </b><br /></p><p>An elated Pathan said he was looking forward to play the games for Abahani Limited. Notably, Pathan will be available only until Abahani's next game as he is set to return to India for Ramadan. "I was looking forward to play these two matches before Ramadan. The team has won [yesterday] and this will work as an advantage as they move forward in the competition. I am happy that I have performed and added around 60 runs to the board," Pathan was quoted as saying by Dhaka tribune. </p><p>Pathan plays under Tamim Iqbal who himself starred with a patient knock of 40 on Wednesday. His Kolkata Knight Riders teammate Shakib Al Hasan failed to trouble the scorers much. </p><p>Notably, Pathan notched up 361 runs from 15 matches in the recently concluded ninth season of the Indian Premier League at a staggering average of 72.20. The all-rounder came to the rescue whenever his team was in trouble and led his team into the playoff stages of the tournament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
