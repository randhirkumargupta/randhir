<storybody><![CDATA[<p>As veteran politician Ajit Jogi heads home in a huff, there are mixed feelings at Congress headquarters in Delhi. Miffed at being ignored by the Congress high command, Jogi has threatened to form his own party in Chhattisgarh. </p><p>Ajit Jogi attacked the Congress at a press conference in Raipur. "The Congress is working as Raman Singh's B Team. I am going to my hometown and will decide on my future course of action on June 6," he said, clearly indicating the game was over for him in the Congress.</p><p><b>WILL HE SEE THE LIGHT?</b></p><p>In response, AICC general secretary BK Hariprasad made all the right noises, saying he hoped "Jogi Ji will see the light". Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh added: "It would have been better if he had spoken to the high command. After all, the party gave him everything."</p><p>Interestingly, there had been a public tiff between Jogi and Hariprasad in 2013. Though the matter was hushed up, a complaint was made to the AICC and at the end of it Hariprasad had to eat humble pie. </p><p><b>CONTROVERSIAL PAST</b></p><p>The Jogis - Ajit and his son Amit - are no stranger to controversy. In January this year an audio tape emerged in which there were allegations that the Jogis offered financial inducements to the Congress candidate in the Antagarh bypoll in 2014. The Congress candidate did back down and the BJP candidate won without even a contest.</p><p>After this incident, the state congress president Bhupesh Bhagel suspended Amit Jogi for 6 years from the Pradesh Congress Committee. They also recommended that Ajit Jogi be removed for 6 years from the Congress Working Committee. This matter is still under consideration of the Congress disciplinary committee.</p><p><b>GOOD THAT HE GOES?</b></p><p>Of course, general secretary Digvijaya Singh is not one to mince his words. He said, "For somebody who sold Congress seats, it's good that he goes"... a sentiment quietly echoed by many within the Congress. </p><p>The immediate provocation for Jogi's exit is said to be the Rajya Sabha nomination. Ajit Jogi was confident that his nominee would get through. But the final decision was not to his liking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></storybody>
