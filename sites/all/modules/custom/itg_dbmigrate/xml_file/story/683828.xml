<storybody><![CDATA[<p>His friends and family gathered at their civil lines residence in Delhi to celebrate his birthday. Cakes were there, gifts were brought. But only the birthday boy was missing. Siddharth Sharma would have turned 33 today had he been alive and not mowed down by a speeding Mercedes near civil lines police station on April 4.</p><p>They wanted to celebrate 'Siddharth's memory'. Understandably, the mood was sombre. But on his birthday eve, the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) observed the juvenile accused is fit to be tried as an adult, making him the first such juvenile accused after the government amended the law. An unprecedented observation in a country that has seen juveniles get away with heinous crimes like rape and murder.</p><p><b>A TOUGH BATTLE</b></p><p>Shilpa Mittal, the sister who has been fighting a tough legal battle quips, 'Indeed it's a birthday gift for Sid (Siddharth). At least it's proved that the accused must be tried as an adult. But this battle is far from over'.</p><p>And she has reasons to say that. The prosecution needs to prove why the accused must be tried as an adult all over again, which may or may not uphold the JJB's verdict.</p><p>A little kid, who brought a packet of chocolate for her 'Sid uncle', was asked to cut the cake with 'we will miss you' written on it, his photo fell on the strawberry cake he cherished having. Ali, his friend almost instantly fumbled, 'This can't be a coincidence. He had the first bite'.</p><p><b>A LIVELY SOUL</b></p><p>Saj Khanna, Siddharth's friend who came for his birthday, told <b>Mail Today</b>, 'Siddharth was a very lively person. Always full of life. His life has been abruptly cut short. Probably if there is one gift Siddharth would want today, it is justice'.</p><p>Justice - that seems to be a far away dream for the family right now. But the entire family is 'battle ready'. Shilpa's husband Yogesh says, 'We will fight till the end and ensure he gets justice'. Shilpa with a teary eye agrees, 'It's not a fight any more. It's a war. And we will fight this war'.</p><p><b>Also read:<a target="_blank" href=" http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/delhi-merecedes-hit-and-run-case-juvenile-justice-board/1/683689.html"> Delhi Mercedes hit-and-run case: Accused juvenile to be tried as an adult</a></b>  <br /></p>]]></storybody>
