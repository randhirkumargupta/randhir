<storykicker><![CDATA[Henry Marr, a 6-year-old environmentalist, can't stop crying for the earth which the 'dumb people' are busy wrecking.<br /><br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>While some of us are <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/17-year-old-gorilla-killed-after-boy-falls-into-zoo-enclosure/1/679995.html" target="_blank">shooting down gorillas</a>  and <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/two-lions-killed-to-save-a-suicidal-man-in-a-chilean-zoo/1/675806.html" target="_blank">lions</a>  or throwing garbage out our car windows, <b>a six-year-old boy</b> in Mount Vernon, US, is losing his mind at the state of the earth.</p><p>Little<b> Henry Marr</b>, now famous as the <b>"emotional environmentalist"</b>, was caught on camera crying his eyes out over litterbugs, deforestation and animal slaughter. </p><p><b>"The planet is gonna be wrecked,"</b> he sobs into his hands as the video begins, "People are just being rude to it,". He goes on to lament about how people "throw trash on the ground," "make forests into places...into roads," etc. </p><p>It is most touching when he struggles to catch his breath as he sobs about 'baby animals': "Oh my gosh, the baby animals... They eat the garbage. I hate the people who make them do that!"</p><p><b>"I just don't want animals to die...I wish I was an adult right now."</b> When his mother, who is shooting the video, asks him why he wishes to be an adult, he responds, "I just want to do my job right now,".</p><p>Before you mistake this to be a child's adorable meltdown, let us tell you that Henry means business.</p><p><br /></p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbjabTS5kac" mce_src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbjabTS5kac" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404" width="647"></iframe><p><br /></p><h3>'Enjoy the Planet, Don't Wreck It'</h3><p>This video, which already has <b>over 17million views</b>, is not yet another 'cute-kid-goes-viral' clip. Henry's passion for the planet goes beyond just an emotional breakdown.</p><p>Although he pledges on camera that he will "try and fight off" those wrecking the planet when he grows up," Henry has not paused his crusade to save the earth while he is still a child.</p><p>He has fashioned himself a utility jacket, which he dons and hits the streets to look out for litter, injured animals, etc. </p><p>He has also authored a picture book named <i><b>Enjoy the Planet, Don't Wreck It</b></i>, which goes on to show how serious he is about his passion.</p><p>Henry's tearful rant has already <b>inspired scores of people to change in their attitude towards the environment</b>; a promise they made in the comment thread.</p><p>"This is how he's being a helper before he is a grown up. His emotions and compassion will teach many to realize what they are doing to our planet and to our animals," write a Facebook user.</p><p><br /></p><h3>"I'm not going to yell at them. I have a better idea..."</h3><p>Henry's breakdown was triggered by a film he watched in school about the harmful humans impact that is slowly taking down the planet.</p><p>"Picked Henry up from school the other day and I had no idea he was this passionate about our planet," his mother captioned the video on Facebook.</p><p>So, let's learn from this little guy, let his immense passion rub off on us a bit. And in case you don't feel like paying heed, beware. Henry has a punishment planned for those who won't stop harming the environment.</p><p><b>"I'm not going to yell at them. I have a better idea...yell in their ear!"</b></p><p>Right now, however, he has something else to tell his audience. Give him a listen: <br /></p><p><br /></p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsKOi0hlQns" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><p><b><br /></b></p><h3><b>And guess who shared his video<br /></b></h3><p>Impressed and moved by Henry's video, even<b> Leonardo DiCaprio</b>, known as much as an environmentalist as an actor, couldn't resist sharing it. He said "a future activist is born" about little Henry. </p><div><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLeonardoDiCaprio%2Fposts%2F10153537923352116&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="329" width="500"></iframe></div><p><br /></p>]]></storybody>
