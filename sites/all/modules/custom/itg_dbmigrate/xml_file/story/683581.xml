<storykicker><![CDATA[Twitter criticised MP Hema Malini for her apparent lack of sensitivity when she tweeted pictures from her shooting even as her constituency Mathura remained embroiled in violence.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Members of a religious sect illegally occupying a public park in Mathura attacked police officials on Thursday with swords, knives, guns and grenades. The authorities had only recently won a court order for their eviction.</p><p>The carnage that followed led to the death of two police personnel - the Superintendent of police and the Station House Officer - and 22 members of the sect. Mathura's nerves remained tense on Friday morning. But, local MP Hema Malini was apparently in a completely different zone.</p><p>Bollywood's dreamgirl took to Twitter to share pictures while she was en route to her shooting location. "Hoping for an early release of this film," she wrote, inviting the anger of many users. Twitter criticised Hema for her apparent lack of sensitivity and opposition parties pointed out how her tweets were inappropriate.</p><p>In light of all the flak she got, the actor deleted her tweets and shared her views about the ongoings in Mathura, but the damage was already done.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I just came bk frm Mathura &amp; got the news of the violence tht has taken place there in which policemen have lost their lives.</p>�??

She said she was completely unaware of the situation until two months ago. </p><p>"I'm told this has been happening for the past two years, but I came to know only two months ago that these people have encroached on the place," she said.</p><p>"When I go, they take me to some villages and say please rectify the drainage system or rectify the roads or please provide electricity. These are the issues they come out with," she added.</p><p>She blamed the UP government for not supporting police. "The death of the police personnel could have been avoided. Administration had been told to give more forces, but UP government did not give a go-ahead. For two months the police was fighting with the encroachers and yesterday, the issue erupted in a manner which was not expected at all," said Malini.</p><p><b>REPEAT OFFENDER</b></p><p>This is not the first time the actress has received criticism for seemingly insensitive tweets. After television actress Pratyusha Banerjee committed suicide, Malini took to twitter to criticise people who commit suicide.</p><p>{mosimage}</p><p>{mosimage}&nbsp;</p><p>In July 2015, Hema Malini's Mercedes collided with another car in Rajasthan's Dausa district. A four-year-old girl died in the accident. The 66-year-old actor faced flak for not helping the child.</p><p>An angry Hema Malini criticised the media for trying to malign her, and went on to bash the child's father on Twitter for not following traffic rules. Those tweets weren't received very well either.<br /></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just going thro ur replies!The accident has shown me how much u ppl love me &amp; care for my welfare.
