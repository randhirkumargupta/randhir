<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Amateur boxing's decision to allow professionals into the Olympics for the first time drew fighting talk on Wednesday from champions and sanctioning bodies opposed to the break with tradition.</p><p>The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC), which governs the country's professional fight scene, said the change was dangerous, disrespectful and "against the spirit of the Olympics".</p><p>"It is the hope of the British Boxing Board of Control and many within the professional Sport in Great Britain and throughout the world that AIBA reconsider such a move that is not beneficial to the sport as a whole," it added in a statement.</p><p>AIBA, the international boxing association for amateurs, earlier approved a constitutional change that would allow professionals to compete at the Rio Games in August.</p><p>AIBA boss Ching-Kuo Wu told <i>Reuters</i> in Lausanne that the change to the AIBA constitution was approved with 95 per cent in favour - 84 of 88 voting members.</p><p>It follows a decision in March to extend the scrapping of headguards in men's amateur boxing - introduced three years ago - to the forthcoming Olympics.</p><p>Some 26 Olympic spots will be up for grabs when fighters compete at a qualifying tournament in Venezuela next month.</p><p>While an AIBA spokesman said the governing body was "acting for the Olympic legacy" and rejected fears that there would be a disparity between amateurs and professionals, boxers with experience of both disagreed.</p><p><b>PROFESSIONALS vs AMATEURS</b></p><p>"They're two different sports. It's like a badminton player playing tennis," said Northern Ireland's Carl Frampton, a former amateur who has won WBA and IBF world title belts at super-bantamweight, on Twitter.</p><p>"What about the amateurs who have been dreaming of the Olympics for years, have yet to qualify, and some pro takes their spot at the last minute?"</p><p>Britain's former professional world champions Carl Froch and Ricky Hatton also criticised the change.</p><p>"Goodbye amateur boxing now as far as I'm concerned. Can't say I'm a fan of this," said Hatton, the former world welterweight and light-welterweight world champion, on his Twitter feed.</p><p>Former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who as an amateur won gold at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympic Games, last week branded the proposal "ridiculous".</p><p>"It's ridiculous, it's foolish, and some of the pro fighters are going to get beat by the amateurs. It's just going to happen, I really believe that," the 49-year-old told Reuters.</p><p>American Oscar De La Hoya, who won boxing gold at the 1992 Olympics as a lightweight, and went on to become a professional world champion, has also spoken out against opening up the Olympic tournament.</p><p>"Nearly a quarter-century ago, when I was just an amateur boxer, I stood atop a podium in Barcelona and was presented with what I still consider the greatest prize of my career - the Olympic gold medal," he wrote in the Los Angeles Times in April.</p><p>"Had professionals been allowed to participate in the ring that year, I would not have made it so far."</p>]]></storybody>
