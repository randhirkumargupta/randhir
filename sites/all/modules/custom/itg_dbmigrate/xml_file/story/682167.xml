<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Narender, an electrician in Ghaziabad does not know much about government's much talked about and flagship Skill India programme aimed towards training people across the country. Moreover, he is not much interested towards getting any training or any certificate which could turn him into a certified professional. "I have seen advertisements on television about the Skill India programme. But, I never thought of getting any training through this scheme. In fact, I don't need any right now," he said. </p><p><b>NO BENEFIT</b> <br /></p><p>When asked about the reasons for not being keen on going through a training course he cited examples of many other people who have done similar course from ITI or polytechnic institutes. "Some of my friends have done courses. But, what is the benefit. I think for people like us only money matters at the end of the day. I am earning more than what they are earning after getting a certificate," he added. Mail Today met many other people, including plumbers, electricians, motor-mechanics working in the unorganised sector.</p><p><b>REALITY</b> <br /></p><p> While some of them said that getting a certificate from a recognised institute is necessary to get a job in some private companies, many others opined that they have learned the tricks of the trade while working in their respective fields. On the other side, many people said that there is huge demand of skilled workers in big cities and the government's scheme has offered them various choices of getting training and certificates from institutes spread all across the country.</p>]]></storybody>
