<storybody><![CDATA[<p>Following the arrest of five persons, including two workers of a prominent multi-specialty hospital in Delhi, for allegedly running a kidney racket, police are now investigating a money trail to trace the kingpin, as well as those who paid lakhs to get "illegal kidneys'' by providing forged documents to donors.</p><p>According to top police sources, legal action will be taken against all recipients and donors associated with the kidney racket. This includes businessmen and other influential patients who got a kidney transplant via dubious means.</p><p>According to a senior police official, Rajukumar Rao has stopped using his local contacts. "Numbers and mobiles used by Rao have been changed and he is continuously changing his location. He is no more contacting his local agents suspecting they might have been exposed after the syndicate was unearthed."<br /><b><br />TRACKING MONEY TRAIL</b></p><p>Cops are also tracking Rao's money trail by scanning bank accounts of his associates. According to police, Rao alias Raju has been running the kidney syndicate for the last 10 years and has expanded his network to almost all states, with his agents looking for potential donors in rural areas.</p><p>Rao is well connected with the hospital as well as pathology staff, which helps him to source the details of patients. Rao used to keep one-third of the total deal as part of his commission while only 10 per cent reached the actual donor.</p><p>Initial investigation by the police reveals that this year alone five kidney transplant operations were conducted in a leading private hospital in Delhi. During the initial probe, cops have identified a businessman from a posh locality in Ghaziabad along with locating addresses of recipients in Jaipur and Hyderbad.</p><p><b>ORGAN BAZAAR</b></p><p>A police team will soon question these people and also verify documents submitted by them. At present, five donors, including three women, are admitted at a leading hospital, who allegedly were in touch with the gang.</p><p>On Friday, Delhi Police busted a kidney racket allegedly operating at the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, which used to deal with organ transplantation. Commercial trade in organs is illegal in India and transplant donations to non-relatives must be approved by a special committee.</p><p>"We will take legal action against both the donors and recipients. We cannot disclose their identity at the moment," said Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East), Mandeep Singh Randhawa, citing section 19 (Punishment for commercial dealings in human organs) Transplant of Human Organ Act.</p><p>All recipients, whose donors belonged to the gang, paid over Rs 40 lakh for each transplant, using forged documents by the agents. During the whole process, a nominal sum of Rs three to four lakh used to reach financially weak donors mostly from slums or rural areas, police said. The exact number of patients and donors connected with the gang can be gauged only after the arrest of alleged kingpin Rajukumar Rao, who is on the run.</p><p><b>ALSO READ:</b></p><p><a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/japanese-company-old-toys-limbs-educate-children-organ-donation/1/676803.html" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/japanese-company-old-toys-limbs-educate-children-organ-donation/1/676803.html"><b>Japanese company uses old toys with different limbs to educate children about organ donation</b> </a> <br /></p>]]></storybody>
