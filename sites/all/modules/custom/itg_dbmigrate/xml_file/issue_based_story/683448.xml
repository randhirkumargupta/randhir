<storykicker><![CDATA[When asked what she misses the most, Seema Sood says she's never seen the inside of a mall. <br /><br />]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>The says that she could not have committed suicide. That it was tough to hold a piece of glass in her hands. Else, she would not have petitioned the President of India for euthanasia in 2007. "We wouldn't be talking either," she smiles. Meekly. Seema Sood no longer looks like her profile picture on Facebook. The one in which she has long never-ending thick hair and a radiant face like most Himachali girls. </p><p>An almost studio-like setting picture with green trees in the background. She is not wearing thick spectacles in that either. She weighs less than 40 kg now. She is 47 and has been walking with a stick since she was 28. Bed-ridden since 1994, she has two degrees from BITS Pilani, MSc in Engineering Technology and Masters in Engineering, where she scored 90 per cent and 98 per cent respectively.<br /></p><p>"I have always been a gold medallist," she says, quite matter of fact. Before she graduated from BITS in 1991, she started feeling the pain. It started with her toes. It was the year 1988. The doctors thought it was arthritis. But actually it was Rheumatoid arthritis; an autoimmune disorder that results in swollen and painful joints affects joints. </p><p>It may result in low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs and the heart. Her actual condition was diagnosed in 2014. When in 2005, her condition worsened and she reached Fortis, Mohali where she was advised joint and hip replacement surgeries at a cost of Rs 10 lakh, Sood, whose father had passed away in the year 2000 and mother, who is now 81, went quiet. </p><p>"I did not know what to say hearing the cost of surgery. I think that was the moment I knew that dying made sense, much more sense." The mother-daughter duo went back to Palampur. After the Himachal Pradesh government heard of Sood's euthanasia petition to the President in 2007, they promised to take care of her medical expenses of the surgery, which was conducted in 2008. </p><p>Sood went back to her native place. And she also slowly went back to pain and discomfort. She is a bit tired now. "Tired, also of telling my story." We ask her what she misses the most and she says, "I have never seen a shopping mall in my life. I have seen it on TV." If she didn't have this disease, she could have gone far. "I would have been a CEO of a top company. That was far for me." </p><p>In touch with batch mates? Do they know you are here, for a disease with such complex spellings? Smiles. "I never told them. I did not want any pity. But one day in 2014, the silver jubilee year of our batch, a friend messaged, asking if I would be attending. I could not stop myself from telling her. She didn't say much. The next day, another batchmate, who now lives in Jammu drove all the way to my house in Palampur. He just said, "We won't let you die. My house runs because of my batchmates scattered across the world--US, Middle East, UK." </p><p>She is also painting nowadays. "I have even made a painting for my mother. She doesn't know it. It is going to be a surprise for her. My first painting was of a red rose. I bought colours for Rs 10 and painted it. You must not leave before seeing all my chart papers." She feels her doctor is the best thing to have happened to her. </p><p>"We keep in touch through WhatsApp. He keeps telling me that I must not give up," she says. Anil Abrol, 36, is the good doctor, the kind of man who wears an ironed shirt and formal trousers. And smiles often. He says that when the hospital authorities wanted to reexamine Sood, he could not help but be excited about being part of the team. </p><p>He remembers that the first time she came, Sood had to be carried by two people. "I have always been in touch with her--talking to her, messaging her. I have one goal --she has to be made independent, no matter what." Why are you doing all this? "Is a doctor not supposed to?" Why are you doing all this? "Because somewhere medical science is still not just about money." </p><p>Why does she want to live now, we ask Seema? "I have hope."</p>]]></storybody>
