<storykicker><![CDATA[As six African students studying in Jalandhar sing 'Patiala Peg', Punjabis world over tap into a new high.]]></storykicker>
<storybody><![CDATA[<p>They insist that they know what a Patiala Peg really is, though haven't tried it yet. But before they start talking about themselves, they want to know if journalism is a "cool" career option and provides enough opportunity to travel and meet interesting people. This is the group of six students from Zambia and one from Malawi studying at the CT Group of Institutions in Jalandhar, whose rendition of Diljit Dosanjh's very popular 'Patiala Peg' that released in 2014, has gone viral on YouTube.</p><p>They may not be able to understand or speak Punjabi, but they have surely managed to precipitate a smile from Punjabi music lovers across the world. The students wrote the lyrics in Roman script and seeked the facultyï¿½??s help to understand the meanings. "The teachers have always been very supportive. It was important for us to understand the meaning of the song in order to internalise the same. Despite the cultural differences, we could relate to what had been written," says Daniel Ngoma, 22-year-old singer and guitarist, who is enrolled in the BSc IT course at the institute.{mosimage}</p><p>The video sees five more first year African students including Temwanani Nyasulu,18, a bio technology student who is seen rapping, Bass guitarist Mwenya Mukalula Steven, 21, studying BBA student, Pianolist George Mafuchi, 21, from the pharmacy department, drummer Lottie Mukuka, 21, from the BCA course, and lyricist Mando Chiunoaponde,19, who is persuing her BSc in economics. </p><p>Though Patiala Peg may have got international attention, but this is not the first time that they have attempted to sing in Punjabi. In January this year, this group sang the popular Sundry Mundri Ho for a cultural function at the campus. </p><p>"We just had a day to prepare for a performance. We wanted to present something that would surprise everybody. So, a night before, we googled the most popular Punjabi songs. The lyrics of 'Sundri Mundri Ho' were available in English. That did it for us," says Nyasulu. Talking about how they zeroed in on their recent song, Nyasulu says that ever since they enrolled in the institute, they have wanted to bridge the gap between themselves and other students. </p><p>"Nobody wants to be seen as the other. Obviously, we stand out, considering our skin colour. This song, we thought would facilitate an immediate connect with everyone." </p><p>So, are they excited about the extraordinary response they have got on YouTube? And what about some racist comments? "The idea behind the whole exercise was to have a lot of fun, which we did. As far as the racist comments are concerned, one learns to ignore them and not let them affect you," says Mukuka. These youngsters, who hail from a continent known for its diverse genres of music, also hold classes for other students at the campus. </p><p>"After class, we jam with Indians studying at the campus almost every day. We may not be able to understand each other's music completely, there is a certain rhythm that binds us all. And it's called fun," smiles Mafuchi. What about more videos? Are they not being flooded with offers? Speed Records, the company, which shot their maiden video may want them to do some more but they are clear that they can't even think about it before their final exams. <br /><br /><b>Also Read: <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/a-group-of-african-students-just-recorded-a-brilliant-version-of-patiala-peg/1/654141.html" target="_blank" mce_href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/a-group-of-african-students-just-recorded-a-brilliant-version-of-patiala-peg/1/654141.html">This brilliant version of Patiala Peg by a group of African students is going viral for all the right reasons</a> </b></p><p>"None of us wants to compromise on academics. For us, scoring well and maintaining our attendance record is paramount in the scheme of things. Of course, we love music and are really happy with the way our efforts have been hailed by everybody. But then, doing well in studies is of utmost importance for all of us. After all, this is what we are here for, thousands of miles away from home." </p><p>Ask them if their parents back home have seen the video, and Mafuchi says, "They like the fact that we are enjoying ourself and participating in extra-curricular activities, but under no circumstances do they want us to forget that academics should remain at the top of our agenda." As we proceed to the fields for the photo shoot, people stop their vehicles and almost cause traffic jam. </p>

<p>A group of young Punjabi boys, dressed like Punjabi singers stop their decorated motorcycles. Many of them tell us that they have seen their video. They desperately want to be photographed with them. All of them make 'victory' gestures, generally associated with Punjabi singers for the camera. Africans included</p>]]></storybody>
