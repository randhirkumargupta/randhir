              <p>LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce has appointed
Simon Kirby, the head of British high-speed rail project HS2, as
chief operating officer, the aerospace and engineering group
said on Saturday.</p>
              <p>British media said Kirby's unexpected departure from HS2
would add to the uncertainty over a 55 billion pound ($73
billion) project that has been controversial both among the
public and within the ruling Conservative Party.</p>
              <p>Rolls-Royce said Kirby would take up the newly created post
in the coming months and would take responsibility for the
"group-wide transformation agenda".</p>
              <p>The company is part-way through a turnaround plan after a
string of profit downgrades last year, attributed to cancelled
orders from oil industry customers after an oil price plunge and
a slowdown in aftermarket servicing for aircraft engines.</p>
              <p>The group said in July the plan was starting to take hold
and it stuck to its full-year profit forecast.</p>
              <p>"(Kirby's) exceptional track record in delivering complex
major programmes is highly relevant to Rolls-Royce and will
strengthen management capability ahead of a period of
significant expansion," Chief Executive Warren East said in a
statement.</p>
              <p>"We are doubling our production of large civil aircraft
engines and substantially growing our nuclear division while at
the same time driving a transformation programme that will make
us a more resilient and cash generative business," he said.</p>
              <p>Kirby is chief executive of HS2 Ltd, the company in charge
of planning and delivering a new high-speed rail network linking
London to cities in the Midlands and the north.</p>
              <p>He joined HS2 in May 2014 from Network Rail, the body that
controls Britain's railway infrastructure, where he was a board
member. He will not join the Rolls-Royce board.</p>
              <p>"I am hugely proud to be joining one of the world's great
engineering companies at an exciting time in its development,"
Kirby was quoted as saying in the statement from Rolls-Royce.</p>
              <p>The first phase of HS2, which will run from London to
Birmingham, is due to be completed in 2026, although there have
been multiple warnings from critics of the project that it would
not be completed on time or on budget.</p>
              <p>Opponents of HS2 say it is far too costly and will not
deliver the economic benefits promised by successive
governments, while advocates of the project say it will
stimulate growth in the Midlands and northern England.
