 * Although the file list table here is avaliable for theming,
 * it is not recommended to change the table structure, because
 * it is read and manipulated by javascript assuming this is the deafult structure.
 * You can always change the data created by format functions
 * such as format_size or format_date, or you can do css theming which is the best practice here.
