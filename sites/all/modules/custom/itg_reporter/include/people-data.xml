Born in Gah (now in Punjab, Pakistan), his family had migrated to India during Partition. The renowned economist was the only prime minister since Pt Jawaharlal Nehru to return to power after completing a full five-year term, and the first Sikh to hold the office.

A doctorate in economics from Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations in 1966-69 before beginning his career as a bureaucrat when he was hired as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade by Lalit Narayan Mishra. The 1970s and 1980s saw him at key posts such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972-76), governor of the Reserve Bank of India (1982-85) and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission (1985-87). His big moment came in 1991 when then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao appointed him India's finance minister as India faced a severe economic crisis.

Singh is credited with opening India's economy as he carried out several structural reforms. Even as his stature as a leading reform-minded economist grew globally, the Congress lost the 1996 general election. Later, Singh served as Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance government ruled the country from 1998 to 2004.

His another big moment came in 2004 when Congress president Sonia Gandhi stepped aside, making way for him as India's prime minister after the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to power.

She was a popular film star, who appeared in over 140 Tamil, Telugu, Kannada films and worked in one Hindi film, before entering politics. She was a member of the Rajya Sabha elected from Tamil Nadu during 1984-89.

The general secretary of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Jayalalithaa is called 'Amma' (Mother) and sometimes 'Puratchi Thalaivi' (Revolutionary Leader) by her followers. In April 2011, the AIADMK led a 13-party alliance that won the 14th state assembly elections. When Jayalalithaa expelled her close aide Sasikala Natarajan and 13 others from the party on December 19, 2011, most of the party members welcomed her decision.

However, Natarajan was reinstated as a party member after issuing a written apology following a report (in February 2012) by a magazine that she and some of her relatives were conspiring to kill. Talking of controversies, Jayalalithaa had also been barred from standing as a candidate in the 2001 elections because she had been found guilty of criminal offences.</main_text><byline></byline><kicker_image>jaya+pti_022814075822.jpg</kicker_image><kicker_image_alt_text></kicker_image_alt_text><metakey>j. jayalalithaa, tn cm Jaya, tamil nadu CM jayalalithaa, jayalalithaa</metakey><metadesc>Jayalalithaa Jayaram is the second elected woman chief minister of Tamil Nadu.</metadesc><sef_url>j.-jayalalithaa.html</sef_url></row>

He recieved his education from The Lawrence School, Sanawar near Kasauli. Shortly afterwards, he came back to Mumbai and was signed for his first film Rocky which released in 1981. However, just three days before the release of the film, his mother died leading Sanjay to plunge into the ugly world of drug addiction.

Following this troubled phase, Sanjay took a break for two years in order to recuperate and joined back the industry in 1985 to resume his career. Since then he has acted in some of the most loved and commercially succesful films till date. 

Some of his noteworthy films during the 90s include Sadak, Saajan and Khal Nayak, which went on to establish him as one of the top actors of those times. However, fate had other plans for Sanjay when in 1993 he was arrested on charges of involvement in the 1993 Mumbai bombings. After spending 18 months in jail, he was granted bail in April 1995. 

Sanjay made his comeback in 1999 and delivered a string of powerful performances in films such Vaastav: The Reality, for which he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award. He went on to star in blockbuster films such as Mission Kashmir, Kurukshetra and Kaante. Then Sanjay went on to act in the National Award-winning blockbuster Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. in 2003, which garnered him innumerable awards and made him the nation's favourite. He won critical acclaim for his performances in Shabd and Zinda.

Sanjay went on to star in the equally successful sequel to Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., Lage Raho Munna Bhai in 2006. However, all this success was going side-by-side with Sanjay's court proceedings. Finally, The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement on 21 March 2013, convicted Dutt of illegal possession of arms relating to the 1993 Mumbai blasts case and sentenced him to five years imprisonment. Currently, Sanjay is serving his term in prison.

Sanjay had been married twice before, first to deceased actor Richa Sharma with whom he has a daughter Trishala and then to model Rhea Pillai, who he later divorced.

The 44-year-old fourth term MLA, who worked for long under the shadows of stalwarts like Pramod Mahajan, Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari, has deep roots in RSS and was handpicked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party Chief Amit Shah over his seniors for his organisational skills after BJP's triumphant run in Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.

The untimely death of Mahajan and Munde, the latter was tipped for chief ministership if BJP came to power in the state, and Gadkari's shift to the national stage, left a vacuum in state party leadership but opened a new vista for the young leader's march to Mantralaya, the seat of power in Maharashtra.

In a state dominated by Maratha politicians, Fadnavis is only the second Brahmin Chief Minister after estranged former ally Shiv Sena's Manohar Joshi and second youngest to hold the top post after NCP boss Sharad Pawar.

The soft spoken and portly young leader was a clear favourite for the coveted job through the intense lobbying by a clutch of leaders from BJP's state Core Committee after it emerged as the single largest party but always looked certain to clinch it, with the solid backing from Modi and Shah.

&quot;Devendra is Nagpur's gift to the country,&quot; Modi had said of him at an election rally, clearly indicating his preference for the man groomed in true RSS tradition like himself.

Though Modi had launched a presidential-style campaign blitzkrieg in Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly polls, credit for the emphatic victories also went to Fadnavis, the state BJP president.

Together with Shiv Sena and Swabhimani Shetkari Paksha, the saffron alliance had won 42 of the state's 48 Lok Sabha seats.

Despite its messy separation with Sena just ahead of the Assembly election, BJP won 122 seats in the 288-member House, up from 46 in 2009. Its strength has, however, come down to 121 following the death of an MLA Govind Rathod. (More) PTI SK

Son of RSS activist and BJP MLC late Gangadhar Fadnavis, whom his fellow Nagpur politician and former party chief Nitin Gadkari calls his &quot;political guru&quot;, Fadnavis cut his teeth in politics at a young age when he joined Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the students wing of RSS, in 1989.

At 22, he became a corporator in the Nagpur civic body and its youngest Mayor in 1997 at the age of 27.

Fadnavis contested his first Assembly election in 1999 and won. There was no looking back for the strong proponent of a separate Vidarbha state as he won three subsequent Assembly elections. He currently represents Nagpur South West seat in the House.

Unlike many leaders across the political spectrum in Maharashtra, Fadnavis has remained untainted by accusations of corruption.

Clearly one of the most articulate of top Maharashtra politicians, Fadnavis is also credited with pushing the previous Congress-NCP government into a corner over the alleged irrigation scam, which many allege is primarily responsible for the spate of suicide by farmers in the parched Vidarbha region.

The Vidarbha cause was so close to his heart that during a debate on a separate state he once angrily told &quot;chalte waha (get out of Vidarbha)&quot; to Shiv Sena MLAs, then an ally of BJP.

Shiv Sena has been consistently opposing division of Maharashtra to create Vidarbha state.

However, Fadnavis toned down his pro-Vidarbha rhetoric during the Assembly poll campaign when BJP was accused by Sena of contemplating splitting the state if voted to power, saying though the party favoured smaller states for administrative efficiency, creation of new states was within the purview of the Centre.

With a clean public image and solid backing from Modi-Shah combine, the young leader from Nagpur, from where RSS runs its writ over the larger saffron family, snuffed out all competition to emerge the winner.</main_text><byline></byline><kicker_image>profile_300x350_103114053728.jpg</kicker_image><kicker_image_alt_text></kicker_image_alt_text><metakey></metakey><metadesc></metadesc><sef_url>devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-cm.html</sef_url></row>
