This is the second time I am performing at Swar Utsav. After over a decade I am pleased to be performing at a platform, which has always appreciated the finesse of the traditional music genres of India. I have had a great relationship with Music Today since the time they produced and released my Sufi album "Tera Ishq" with them and it is a pleasure for me to come back to the stage of Swar Utsav with Music Today. I am looking forward to performing the Sufiana Kalam of Baba Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, Waris Shah, Mian Mohammed Baqsh, Shahbaz Qalandar and other sufi saints who have contributed to this sublime movement of Sufism centuries ago. These compositions are a mix of traditional treasures as well as creations that I have put together over many years of my involvement in Sufi Music. 
Good listeners are a must for any art form to flourish and I am glad that Delhi has always appreciated poetry, music and art in its finest forms. Platforms like Swar Utsav attract genuine music lovers who form a critical part of this eco-system.</li>

I have had a long relationship with Music Today. I have been a part of Swar Utsav right from its inception back in year 2000. After various landmark albums and performances for Music Today, I am pleased to be on the Swar Utsav stage once again. Festivals like Swar Utsav should be encouraged and promoted as they preserve the heritage of Indian music in all its varied forms. I have myself performed across various genres including classical, light classical, folk and devotional.
This year I look forward to presenting to the music lovers of Delhi, a unique mÃ©lange of sacred texts, bhajans and excerpts from epics interwoven together in an interesting musical canvas. It is a delight to see ardent music fans gathering to hear authentic music and while this is a common phenomenon in smaller towns of India, this kind of passion for music is heartening to see in bigger cities like Delhi.

The most exciting thing in the delhi music scene is that swar is being revived. At one time most looked forward to kind of festivals, it is a great event for Delhi. There is a whole magic around doing outdoor concerts. It's not always easy as so many things need to be taken into consideration. But such unique concerts have a great energy. One often thinks that people come to such festivals with the mindset of coming to a mela but that is not always true. They often come with a single-minded plan to listen to good music and with all this coming together the effect is one of very high energy. This time the more exciting thing the  different kinds of Acts and styles being presented on one stage. Every kind of music lover gets a chance to experience something they love.

For me in particular performing with Vikku ji is spectacular though he is senior to me. The excellence of his performance is merged with his simplicity and is just beautiful. George is one of the top 5 foreign artistes who really understands Indian music. It is beautiful and haunting in the night sky with the tenor and alto sax of George brooks. So the performance is a lovely blend of Hindustani, Carnatic and Western thought. It would create magic. I am glad not only because I am playing there but I would love to even attend some of the other sessions as a listener at the festival.

Bibi Ashupreet Kaur (Jalandhar):</strong><br/>
This is for the first time that I have been invited to perform at the Swar Utsav. I feel very lucky to be a part of this major festival as Swar Utsav is known to be the biggest Indian music festival in Delhi. I have been fortunate enough to learn Shabad Kirtan from Late Prof. Paramjyot Singh in Jalandhar and presently learning classical music under the guidance of Vidushi Ashwini Bhide Deshpande. Shabad Kirtans were originally written by the Gurus drawing inspiration from the Hindustani classical ragas. In the present times, a lot of light music is altering the way Shabad Kirtan is performed on stage. Though I have performed a couple of times in Delhi before which includes a performance at the Chief Minister's residence, this performance would be a special one for me. Musically, it would be a great opportunity to present and showcase authentic Gurbani Sangeet composed in the morning ragas, as I have been invited to perform in the morning session.

<li> <strong>Warsi Brothers:</strong><br/>
We have been associated with Music Today since 1992. In fact, our entire family has had very close relations with Music Today and Swar Utsav. Our father has performed at Swar Utsav earlier where I was also a part. I am extremely glad to be coming to the same stage once again after so long. We had been waiting for this occasion when Swar Utsav would happen again and we would be a part of it. Alongside the beautiful Delhi crowd, Swar Utsav has so much more to offer. It has all the charms of the intimate baithaks of the past.
The ambience as well as the music at Swar Utsav has always been something to look forward to. Some earlier performances have included beautiful kalams of the most celebrated Sufi saints. We are looking forward to performing at this wonderful stage this year.</li>

<li> <strong>Pt Ajoy Chakrabarty:</strong><br/>
I am indeed happy to know that Swar Utsav has been revived this year after such a long time. I have been closely associated with Music Today for a long time and have also performed and recorded for them a number of times. In my view, Music Today has a major contribution in the propagation and penetration of Indian classical music in this new Millennium in the form of releasing CDs and organizing music festivals for more than last two decades. I sincerely wish the revival and the continuation of the festival, to initiate and educate the present generation about Indian classical and create an interest in learning. I am really glad that this year I am opening the festival. I wish the group a grand success.

I am looking forward to returning to Delhi with Shujaat bhai and Vikkuji to create a confluence of North and South India with my western, jazz-influenced perspective. Delhi is the city where my Indian journey began. In 1980, I spent a year here learning how to be a student of Indian classical music. I entered into the traditional guru-shisha parampara with my teacher, Pandit Pran Nath, and learned to tune my tamboura, sing sargam and speak Hindi. In addition, I learned how a student properly cares for his guruâ€¦even learning how to cook his food. <br/><br/>

My relationship with Vikku ji goes back to 2000, when I was asked to perform in San Francisco with Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia. Vikkuji was on the program along with Swapan Chaudhuri. Vikkuji was instrumental in the birth of Indian/jazz fusion through his groundbreaking work with Shakti. To perform with him and Hariji in the same show was like a dream come true. Several years later, when Zakir was not available for a West Coast tour with my group Summit, I invited Vikku to join us, and he graciously accepted. He is a great performer and also a patient teacher. Working with Vikkuji has greatly expanded my understanding of Carnatic music.<br/><br/>

It is also an honor to perform alongside Shujaat Khan. He is clearly the inheritor of his family's sitar mastery, and I am equally mesmerized by his voice. During my early days in Delhi, I spent much of my time in and around the dargas of Nizamuddin Aulia and Sufi Inayat Khan and Shujaat bhai's beautifully rendered Urdu poetry touches my heart.<br/><br/>

I hope the Delhi audience will appreciate this rare confluence of musical traditions as much as we  will enjoy performing.<Br/><br/>
