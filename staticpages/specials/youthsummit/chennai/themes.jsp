			  <p>More than 50 per cent of India's population is below the age of 25 and more than 65 per cent hovers below the age of 35. It is expected that, in 2020, the average age of an Indian will be 29 years old. These young people are crafting their own rules, adopting new roles, diverging from what tradition demands of them and doing to what they believe is right in a rapidly changing world. Today young people are challenging the norm to emerge as champions of causes, CEOs of companies and icons of different arenas. From science to society, they are redefining it all. For these reasons and more we present the India Today Youth Summit. <br />
<br />
The India Today Youth Summit launched in 2010 offers the young a unique opportunity, in one inspiring day, to hear leaders giving them the mantras for success and the mavericks telling them how to dream big and do bigger. The first year of the summit saw great minds like Nandan Nilekani, Pranav Mistry, Sourav Ganguly and Viswanathan Anand share their experiences with delegates, who turned out in great numbers, making the event a mega success. </p>
            
             <p>Now in its second year, the event still remains a day long conference with the over all theme "Fast Track To Success" but unlike last year the event this year will move beyond speaker engagement and address the young audience directly. Through mediums such as:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Your Say, where shortlisted candidates will get opportunities to voice their opinion on a subject to a varied audience after every session. Each session will have one Your Say, where one young person gets to ask a question in the spotlight. </li>
              <li>Breakaway sessions with select speakers.</li>
              <li>Live music by underground bands during session breaks.</li>
              <li>Counselling time-outs with career counselors on the sidelines.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The summit will aim at encapsulating the spirit of the young by exposing them to an environment that will help them better their personalities, through shared experiences, live discussions and participation all aimed at answering the question: what it takes to make it to the top in the world.</p>
