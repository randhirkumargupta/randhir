                <p class="ptitle">Mind Rocks Concept</p>
                <p>Mind Rocks is a unique concert of live ideas and live music. A forum that brings together the bright young minds of our country to participate in an open two way conversation with some of their icons. A space where inspirational leaders from different spheres of life share their mantras of success.</p>
                <p>A platform of new ideas and new music it allows young minds to engage with decision makers in an informal setting. Learn, share and even teach with their unique and unconditioned perspective on India and the world.</p>
                <p>The one of its kind summit for young minds is a way for us to engage with that part of the society that is going to define our future. Our biggest competitive advantage as a nation. Our demographic dividend. </p>
                <p class="plast">Plug into the electricity of live ideas and live music</p>
                
                <p class="ptitle">Mind Rocks Format/ So what's the POA?<br />You choose</p>
                <p class="plast">
                The youth always want to be making their own choices. They want to be responsible for their own decisions. And they want options. This generation more so than any other. To reflect that, the conference will give its young delegates a choice at each stage. The format is not rigid and fixed. Itâ€™s fluid. It will have break out sessions, counseling rooms, musical interludes. 
                </p>
                <p class="ptitle">It's a Rocket</p>
                <p class="plast">
                In the life of most youth music is ubiquitous. The ear phones are never out of the ears specially when they are being given gyan by the wise and the old. Mind Rocks has an innovative format to break through the mental barrier and generation gap. A conference that mixes the serious with the entertaining. A conference with musical interludes. The registration, coffee breaks, lunch and the final countdown all have upcoming artists and bands perform for their peer group. So new sounds and new ideas mix inextricably in this summit to create an atmosphere that is electrifying. 
                </p>
                <p class="ptitle">Face 2 face</p>
                <p class="plast">This will be smaller closed door sessions with a few of the speakers where the youth can engage with the speakers in a more intimate manner. The sessions are planned as far more participative and as intense workshops with 50 participants an icon.</p>
                <p class="ptitle">1 on 1</p>
                <p class="plast">Choose your future counseling sessions. A counseling room with a group of hand picked innovative counselors will be set up. These will be out of the ordinary counselors who will be able to advice and organize the thoughts of our young delegates or solve their career issues on traditional as well as non traditional career choices. Counselors who will conduct mini one-on-one assessments with the participants and give them a tangible takeaway to help them with their future. Fit their leadership style or learning ability or talent within a framework to help them choose a better future.</p>
                <p class="ptitle">Your Say</p>
                <p class="plast">The conference is interactive to a point where the sessions are a dialogue rather than a monologue. Not only will you have interactive Q n A but go one step further in creating meaningful engagement by giving the youth a voice. A podium will be placed in the audience. This is more than just a symbolic gesture to say that what the speaker has to say is just as important as what our young audience has to say. But it will be used by pre selected delegates to voice the opinions and ideas representative of their generation. A chance for them to air and voice their unique and often perceptive, passionate, untainted view of the world </p>
                <p class="ptitle">PING Generation</p>
                <p class="plast">The internet is a basic right for this generation. Their right to speak and their right to tweet. The conference will be wired up for all social media apps including live twitter feeds, live questions from the net and blogging.</p>
                <p class="ptitle">Your Wall</p>
                <p class="plast">A traveling graffiti wall where youth can leave their mark with spray cans. Comments, status updates and doodles.</p>
