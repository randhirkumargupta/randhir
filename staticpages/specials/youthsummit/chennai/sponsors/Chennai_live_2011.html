      <strong>Chennai Live 104.8 FM - has its finger on the pulse of contemporary Chennai.  </strong><br>
ChennaiLive is the city's first and the only English radio station. Since its launch in July 2008, it has swiftly caught on with Chennai's cosmopolitan audience; its content mix of current topics and music resonate well with the educated & informed Chennaiite. A media venture from The Muthoot Group, ChennaiLive is aimed exclusively at 1.2 million of the city's total population of 8 million. The radio station's target audience has evolved from the flourishing IT/ITES, Manufacturing & Retail sectors, and is made up of English-speakers with a sensibility that combines global perspectives and local values. <br>
<br>
'The Breakfast Show', with RJ Sano features discussions and debates on local, national & international topics. RJ Rohan Sen hosts the keenly followed 'Hang Out', where he connects with the youth of the city. 'Live Drive' peps up evenings as RJ Disha Oberoi blithely compares notes on auto, travel, films, fashion and lifestyle. RJ Arjun Thomas, a mainstay in the city's rock music scene, offers listeners an array of musical genres on 'One Night Stand' while RJ Tausif regales Quiz aficionados with his 'Quiz Show' every Sunday.<br>
<br>
Prem Kumar, Station Head, says "The philosophy of the station is to bring together a wide range of opinions and viewpoints existing in the city with a profound past, a proud present and a bright outlook for the future."</td>
