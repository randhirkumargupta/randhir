     <strong>VIT scaling dazzling heights</strong><br>
<em>For those aspiring to scale greater heights in technical education, 
the VIT is the ideal destination</em><br>
<br>
The travel of a student afire by a desire to pursue quality technical education ends at VIT located on the Chennai-Bangalore National Highway. The brick and mortar of the imposing building constructed on the sprawling 350 acres, having a built-up area of 4 lakh sq.m. in Vellore are speaking volumes for the successful careers of scores of students who are presently excelling in their spheres of activities all over the world.

<strong>STARS </strong>Dr. G.

Initially, this scheme was started in seven districts:  Cuddalore, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Thiruvannamalai, Kancheepuram, Villupuram and Vellore.
