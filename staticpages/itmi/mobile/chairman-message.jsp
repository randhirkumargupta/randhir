    <p>Dear prospective ITMI-ian,</p>
    <p>Let me compliment you on considering ITMI for admission. For the past 10 years, our endeavour has been to train students to be superior professionals in broadcast journalism: Nearly 300 such professionals now adorn the industry, and many of them are names to reckon with. </p>
    <p>This achievement has  not been incidental: When we start a publication, channel, service or other  activity, there should be no compromise on quality, effort and leadership-that,  indeed, is the value I have endeavoured for us to follow. So as a deliberate  strategy, the institute (earlier called TV Today Media Institute) has adopted  high standards of academic input, blending it with practical and industry  exposure. Our news television channels-<em>Aaj  Tak, Headlines Today, Tez and Dilli Aaj Tak</em>-and our radio network-<em>Oye! 104.8 FM</em>-are not only some of the  leading news disseminators in the country, but are at the cutting edge of  technology application, and our students have enjoyed the obvious benefits from  our state-of-the-art equipment, studios, software, newsgathering and production  resources. Students have been regularly exposed to important guests of the  channels, but have also brought in minds that matter to campus.Consequently, our carefully handpicked students have been well placed at the end of their tenure at the institute. </p>
    <p>The media world has been pushing its boundaries over the past decade-with new forays into online, social media, specialized forms. That is why this year, we have recognized that the media industries and the industries that serve them-advertising, public relations and other forms of brand communication-offer immense opportunities for our professionals, and with that recognition, we have decided to widen the scope of our offerings. </p>
    <p>In its 11th year, ITMI offer one- and two-year postgraduate programmes in a variety of domains within the ambit of communication, including all forms of journalism, audiovisual communication, advertising, public relations, and media management. While aligning themselves with our existing media brands--India Today and other magazines, our newspaper, music and online businesses, these programmes will go well beyond our own brands into the larger mediasphere.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years, ITMI will be the leader in media education in India. It will also continue to be our endeavour to understand the importance of gainful employment at the end of our rigorous programmes, and we will continue to forge formal and informal associations with the related industries. In our efforts to bring to you the best international minds to our campus, we are exploring global partnerships. </p>
    <p>You are at the threshold of a major surge in our media training initiative. I urge you to take full advantage of the several innovative plans our new Dean has for you, and benefit from his vast experience as a media educator of renown. He and his energetic team are always available and willing to help with answers to your questions, so do not hesitate to connect with them!</p>
    <p>Welcome to a great  future in the media. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

      Chairman &amp;  Editor-in-Chief, India Today Group</p>
