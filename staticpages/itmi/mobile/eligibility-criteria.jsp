    <p><strong>Academic : </strong>Entrance to ITMI is competitive, but we do not consider your marks at degree or other levels either for a "cut-off" or for merit for admission. <strong>The age limit for the course is 30 years as on date of admission.</strong> Our testing process alone will make you eligible or ineligible.</p>
    <p>All our postgraduate programmes require you to be a graduate. Three-year diplomas will be considered. A minimum of 15 years of schooling (1st standard through college) is required for admission.</p>
    <p><strong>Incomplete graduation:</strong>If you are in the final year of undergraduate study, you may apply. Submit copies of previous marksheets. Copies of final marksheets and passing certificate must be submitted as soon as results are announced.</p>
