      <p>As media economy solidifies and expands, it has brought about two phenomena: more job opportunities, and more competition for jobs in traditional and new domains. Before you join, please take a reality check-and let's help you do so.</p>
      <div class="down" id="down1">
        <div id="dif">
          <p><strong>Journalism</strong></p>
          <p>As a journalist, you could enter TV or print media as a reporter or editorial professional. While print-still the leading medium for advertisers-has been growing at a steady 7.3%, will steepen its growth pace to 8.7% by 2018. TV grew at 12.5% between 2008 and 2012, and is expected to grow at 18% in the period 2013-18. News television, however, continues to occupy only around 6% of the total viewership pie.</p>
          <p><strong>What you could be</strong></p>
          <p>Newspaper, magazine, TV, web or news agency:Reporter, news writer, news producer, photojournalist;Publishing house: Commissioning editor; Independent or commissioned: Documentarian, blogger / social media communicator. </p>
          <p><strong>Mass Communication/ TV-Radio</strong></p>
          <p>As a broadcast producer, your job would be to make programmes for TV and radio. There is a constant demand for talent at production houses, which supply programmes to TV and radio channels. Apart from the 839 radio licences expected to be auctioned this year, radio will make an enormous leap. </p>
          <p><strong>What you could be</strong></p>
          <p>Production house: Non-fiction programme maker, corporate video producer; TV / radio channel: programme producer, output director; Corporate / Independent: Media researcher</p>
          <p><strong>Communication Studies/ Business</strong></p>
          <p>As a communication specialist, you will be essentially (and as you climb up the ladder) a strategist of brands, services or products, handling the "downstream" industries of advertising, public relations and related activities. The advertising "pie" has grown with the business, and predictably, digital advertising has a huge lead, having grown by over 40% in the past five years. Super specializations still exist within the communication industries, but a student of brand communication can no longer afford to learn only one stream of communication. Managing communication for brands has converged in recent years, including PR, events, activation, image management, in-film branding, and targeted (online) communication activities where your knowledge of the social media will be hugely beneficial. </p>
          <p><strong>What you could be</strong></p>
          <p>Advertising agency : Media planner / buyer, advertising account planner / manager; Public Relations agency : Public relations professional, account planner / manager, event and activation manager; Corporate / independent : Media manager, corporate communication specialist, media researcher, blogger / social media communicator, corporate filmmaker. </p>
          <p><strong>What We Will Not Make You</strong></p>
          <p>While you will have hands-on experience handling the camera, editing and graphics machines, we do not expect you to become camerapersons, VT editors, or other technicians. However, in our experience a few trainees do grow interested in technical positions and obtain them. We will, of course, have no restrictions on them. </p>
          <p>Similarly, your knowledge of music, for example, is for the purpose of understanding the industry and not to be an artiste. While anchoring is an option, we will not train you to be an orator. </p>
          <p>We do not produce creative artists, musicians, actors, designers, animators, instructional designers, or gaming specialists either.</p>
          <p>Within the realm of advertising, copywriters are usually trained in creative writing or language, and will not strictly fall under our training fields. If you want to be in the creative department of an ad agency, you should consider an art or design school instead. </p>
          <p>We will not train you to be film distributors. </p>
          '
          <p>That said, film distribution, gaming, music, and a host of other exciting new industries do entail communication strategy, so you should consider them as an option if you're interested to enter it as a communication strategist. </p>
