    <p><strong>Infrastructure</strong><br>
      <br>
    </p>
    ITMI is equipped with or has access to the best technical infrastructure in the country. Our channels’ studios are state-of-the-art and our trainees have access to them through internships, workshops and visits. Our own studio has cameras and edit machines for training purposes, but all the equipment is industry-standard—whether it is our cameras, the PCR, edit consoles, news software, audio equipment, or other applications.
    </p>
    <p>Our academic infrastructure includes a "Cybrary"-our online and offline resource centre that has a large collection of books, magazines, and thousands of online journals. All our classrooms are audiovisual-capable.</p>
    <p>India Today’s cafeterias down the road offer wholesome and hygienic food. Coffee and tea are available in our kitchen.</p>
    <p><strong>Housing</strong><br>
      <br>
    <p>While ITMI does not have on-campus residence, the institute has tied up with local guest houses. Separate residences for men and women are available. This accommodation is available about 3 km off-campus.<br>
      We have deliberately chosen this location because:<br>
      -The hostels are at a walkable distance from Noida City Centre Metro Station<br>
      -A community supermarket is located opposite the men's hostel and a block away from the women's hostel<br>
      -The hostels are located in a gated, security-monitored community where entry is monitored<br>
      -The food is hygienic. Two meals on weekdays and three on weekends are provided, apart from tea and coffee.<br>
      -The rooms are equipped with Wi-Fi, cupboards, beds, common lounge with television, and multiple washing machine units<br>
      -Air conditioning and air cooling, although not provided, are permitted in rooms. (Electricity bill must be paid by user.)<br>
      -Negotiated rent of Rs 7,500 per month for ITMI trainees<br>
      For further details please contact the Administrative Department on campus.</p>
    <p><strong>Housing</strong><br>
      <br>
    <p>ITMI provides transport free of charge from its Sector 57, Noida, campus to Noida City Centre Metro Station via the hostels. Metro rail service is available every few minutes from that station to various parts of Noida, Delhi and New Delhi. The shuttle is available in the morning and evening.</p>
