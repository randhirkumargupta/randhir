      <h3 id="tab1"><strong>Two-Year, Full-Time Postgraduate Diploma in Mass Communication</strong></h3>
      <div class="down" id="down1">
        <div id="dif">
          <p><strong>Structure:</strong> The most comprehensive of all our programmes, this is structured and formatted to suit graduates who need orientation to communication and media and then go on to an advanced level of learning and enter our media and communication industries.</p>
          <p>With three semesters of in-class, lab, studio / field learning, this programme is both rigorous as well as paced strategically to let you learn and contribute.</p>
          <p>It will have two mandatory internships—one in the social sector and another in the industry. A third internship can also be arranged at the end of your tenure in lieu of a job. Internships may be within the India Today Group / TV Today Network or outside of it, appropriate to your interest and aspirations.</p>
          <p><strong>Academic Approach:</strong> The two-year programme comprehensively grounds you in concepts and prepares you for a rewarding career in communication practice or research. Our endeavour will be to prepare you to be independent thinkers and self-starting professionals in the demanding and exciting world of the media and allied industries.</p>
          <p>This means that learning the tools, techniques and technology is only a preliminary surface of what you will learn. Beyond the usual, we will guide you to explore concepts and discover new paradigms in the way that your world of communication will function in future.</p>
          <p>The methodology we employ is largely founded on the innovative approaches we have designed and implemented, whereby learning follows hard work, smart thinking, and a 360-degree approach to understanding the world around you.</p>
          <p><strong>Academic input:</strong> Research-based projects, independent work, internships, practical and field work—often self-inspired and approved by us, and sometimes in far-flung areas—will form the crux of your academic plan at ITMI. Our programme places a high level of credence to your output based on the input you received; therefore, assessment will always be continuous and based on your understanding—not on reproduction of notes. A final research project is required.</p>
          <p><strong>Internship and placement:</strong> Arguably the biggest differentiator between a trainee and a professional is industry interface, and the most time you will spend in the industry while still a trainee is at your internship. You will have three internships, in different settings. Of the three internships, one is in the social sector, while the second will be within the India Today Group (including channels, digital content and marketing, e-commerce, marketing, sales, events, magazines, etc.). The final, longer, job-oriented internship will be industry-wide within your chosen stream. The institute will assist you in every way on internships. In the normal course, internships should be obtainable.</p>
          <p>A Placement Committee is constituted to assist you in securing job offers. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring you’re employable. Because ITMI is a professional institute, our focus in on your employability.</p>
          <p>All eligible candidates are assured placement opportunities.</p>
          <p><strong>Collaborations:</strong> We have ongoing and planned strategic, academic and research collaborations with several international governments and universities, development agencies, and media & communication firms and companies to give you the widest, richest and most global possible spectrum of academic, professional, cultural and communicative learning and hands-on experience.</p>
          <p><strong>Courses:</strong> You may specialize in any of the following domains:</p>
          <p><strong>Audio Visual Production:</strong> You learn both studio and outdoor production in both radio and television. Professional cameras, non-linear edit suites, still photography, studio floor, and unique exposure to the state-of-the-art resources at TV Today Network’s studios and our 6-station national radio network, Oye 104.8 FM will ensure that you are in a producer’s Mecca. You will script and produce at least three films by the time you graduate.</p>
          <p><strong>Digital media:</strong> In digital, unlike in any other medium, you are both the creator of a message and the creator of meaning—a producer as well as a consumer. You will start with learning about strategic communication, content management, media platforms, and other relevant topics to lay a firm and professional foundation for your understanding of digital media and of what communication actually are and entail. On one side, you will learn content creation. How, for example, a news item is made on video and text formats, published, and finally analysed to ensure the audience “buys into” your story. The other side is digital marketing and will expose you to what SEOs and SEMs are, how to generate traffic, how to manage content while understanding your audiences. You will also learn one of the most intriguing of all communication chapters: How to manage the social media.</p>
          <p><strong>Advertising and Public Relations.</strong> With a width of options to choose from, you will be trained in concepts of management, the business of media, advertising, public relations, corporate communications, events, social media, and other forms of promotional communication for commercial or social organizations. You will train to be a promotions specialist of the future through an integrated approach. As in the other specializations, this, too, offers the exposure to and close collaboration with all our media platforms.</p>
          <p><strong>Journalism.</strong> While print, digital and broadcast media are covered, it is our belief that a journalist is one by thinking, and therefore it is important for each trainee to learn tools and techniques of all the three platforms. As FM radio may be permitted soon to broadcast news, we will train you in radio journalism as well. You will regularly produce live news in our studio and benefit hugely from some of India’s best known TV news networks—Aaj Tak, Dilli Aaj Tak, Tez, and Headlines Today, print and online platforms—India Today, Business Today, Mail Today and 30-odd other specialized magazines, and our radio network Oye 104.8 FM.</p>
          <p><strong>Curricular input:</strong> <em>Depending on your specialization, the curriculum and non-curricular activities include a set of more than 30 common and specialized modules (for each specialization), numerous projects, outdoor assignments, industry visits, workshops from renowned professionals, and plenty of guest interactions.</em></p>
