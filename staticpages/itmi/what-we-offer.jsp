              <h3 id="tab1"><strong>Two-year, full-time Postgraduate Diploma in Mass Communication</strong></h3>
              <div class="down" id="down1">
                <div id="dif">
                  <p><strong>Academic approach: </strong>The two-year  programme comprehensively grounds you in concepts and prepares you for a rewarding  career in communication practice or research. Our endeavour will be to prepare  you to be independent thinkers and self-starting professionals in the demanding  and exciting world of the media and allied industries.</p>
                  <p> This means that learning the tools,  techniques and technology is only a preliminary surface of what you will learn.  Beyond the usual, we will guide you to explore concepts and discover new  paradigms in the way that your world of communication will function in future.</p>
                  <p> The methodology we employ is largely  founded on the innovative approaches we have designed and implemented, whereby  learning follows hard work, smart thinking, and a 360-degree approach to  understanding the world around you.</p>
                  <p><strong>Academic input: </strong>Research-based  projects, independent work, internships, practical and field work—often  self-inspired and approved by us, and sometimes in far-flung areas—will form  the crux of your academic plan at ITMI. Our programme places a high level of  credence to your <em>output </em>based on the  input you received; therefore, assessment will always be continuous and based  on your understanding—not on reproduction of notes. A final research project is  required.</p>
                  <p><strong>Internship and placement: </strong>Arguably the biggest differentiator between a trainee and a  professional is industry interface, and the most time you will spend in the  industry while still a trainee is at your internship. You will have two  internships, in different settings. Although internships are your  responsibility, the institute will assist you in every way.</p>
                  <p> A Placement Committee is constituted  to assist you in final placements. Please note that we do not assure  placements. However, we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring you’re  employable. Much of this is a two-way street, and we expect the trainee to  fulfil the expected criteria.</p>
                  <p><em>Refer to the curriculum packet (available when you enrol) for more  details.</em></p>
                  <p><strong>Advisement: </strong>At the beginning of  your first semester, you are assigned to a faculty member for counselling,  mentoring and advising on all matters professional. Feel free to make your  faculty member a confidante! <em>Refer to the  brochure (available upon applying online) for more details.</em></p>
                  <p><strong>Body and Mind: </strong>Several exercises  on and off campus will ensure a healthy mind and a healthy body. <strong> </strong></p>

                  <h3 id="spec"><strong style="text-decoration:underline">Specializations</strong></h3>
                  <div class="down"> <em>You may specialize in any of the following domains:</em>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><strong><em>Journalism.</em></strong> While print, digital and broadcast specializations are covered,  it is our belief that a journalist is one by thinking, and therefore it is  important for each trainee to learn tools and techniques of all the three  platforms. As FM radio may be permitted soon to broadcast news, we will train  you in radio journalism as well. You will regularly produce live news in our  studio and benefit hugely from some of India’s best known TV news networks—Aaj  Tak, Dilli Aaj Tak, Tez, and Headlines Today, print and online platforms—India  Today, Business Today, Mail Today and 30-odd other specialized magazines, and  our radio network Oye 104.8 FM.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Radio-TV Production. </em></strong>You learn both studio and outdoor production in both radio and  television. Professional cameras, non-linear edit suites, still photography,  studio floor, and unique exposure to the state-of-the-art resources at TV Today  Network’s studios and our 6-station national radio network, Oye 104.8 FM will  ensure that you are in a producer’s mecca. You will script and produce at least  three films by the time you graduate.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Communication Management.</em></strong> With a width of options to choose from, you will be trained in  concepts of management, the business of media, advertising, public relations,  corporate communications, events, social media, and other forms of promotional  communication for commercial or social organizations. You will train to be a  promotions specialist of the future through an integrated approach. As in the  other specializations, this, too, offers the exposure to and close collaboration  with all our media platforms. </p>

                <div id="dif2">
                  <p><strong>One-year full-time Postgraduate Diploma in Broadcast Journalism</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Academic approach: </strong>As our  flagship programme, the one-year diploma prepares you to ‘hit the ground  running’ in your career. You will learn what it takes to be a journalist, and  then roll up your sleeves and get down to actually practising what you learn in  the classrooms, labs, studios, library and outdoors. When you graduate from the  programme, you should hope to join one of the hundreds of news channels in the  country. As news on FM radio becomes a reality, you should also be aware of the  immense opportunities there.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Academic input: </strong>This is a  practical-heavy programme—less than half your programme will be in classrooms;  your tenure will be largely entail hands-on learning in simulated settings on  campus, field work, and an internship in our sophisticated studios. A final  project is required.</p>
