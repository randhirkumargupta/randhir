          <p><strong>Including:</strong> <br />
            •	Digital Journalism<br />
            •	Digital Media Marketing</p>
          <h3>Why ITMI? </h3>
          <p class="pad">Digital journalism is already a big reality and a bigger challenge. Yet there is very little hands-on, industry-bound training available, aside from the on-the-job kind. That is the gap ITMI’s new course fills.
            Today’s journalist can no longer afford to super-specialize. One of the biggest challenges for a new or working journalist, though, is how to generate content that connects with the reader, attracts lots of eyeballs and “trends”, thereby making it a marketable and saleable proposition.</p>
          <p>As India Today Group’s education wing, ITMI is uniquely poised to deliver new-generation communication courses. As industries in India increasingly adopt digital communication as integral to their marketing plans, students and working professionals are already feeling the need to upgrade their skills and “digitize” themselves to cope with the amazing new world of digital communication. 
            Programme structure</p>
          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 96 hours over 4 months<br />
            <strong>Days of classes:</strong> Saturdays and Sundays<br />
            <strong>Method:</strong> Interactive lectures, lab, assignments, live projects with India Today Group and other organizations.</p>
          <p>Delivery: If the change that digital communication has brought about must be summed up in one word, that word is “engagement”. Unlike in any other medium, you get a unique opportunity to work in tandem with how your audiences receive your messages. Conceptually speaking, you are both the creator of a message and the creator of meaning.</p>
          <p>You will start with learning about strategic communication, content management, media platforms, and other relevant topics to lay a firm and professional foundation for your understanding of digital media and of what communication actually are and entail. </p>
          <p>The specialized part of the programme then gets into the complexities of all the reasons that digital communication brings: How, for example, a news item is made on video and text formats, published, and finally analysed to ensure the audience “buys into” your story. </p>
          <p>The other specialized part, the digital marketing stream, will expose you to what SEOs and SEMs are, how to generate traffic, how to manage content while understanding your audiences. You will also learn one of the most intriguing of all communication chapters: How to manage the social media. </p>
          <p>Sessions will be conducted by carefully selected digital experts—techies, social media whizzes, content kings and queens, and much more, both from the India Today Group as well as many from outside.
            Special value: You will gain unique exposure to India Today’s digital platforms, opportunity to work on some live projects in social media and other digital formats that may be made available. In the real world, you couldn’t ask for more! </p>
          <p>Certification from the India Today Group.</p>
