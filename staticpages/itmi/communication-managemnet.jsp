            <h3 id="tab1"><strong>Two-Year, Full-Time Postgraduate Diploma in Mass Communication (Advertising and Public Relations)</strong></h3>
            <div class="down" id="down1">
              <div id="dif">
                <p><strong>Advertising and Public Relations: </strong>With a width of options to choose from, you will be trained in concepts of management, the business of media, advertising, public relations, corporate communications, events, social media, and other forms of promotional communication for commercial or social organizations. You will train to be a promotions specialist of the future through an integrated approach. As in the other specializations, this, too, offers the exposure to and close collaboration with all our media platforms.</p>
                <p><strong>Structure: </strong>The most comprehensive of all our programmes, this is structured and formatted to suit graduates who need orientation to communication and media and then go on to an advanced level of learning and enter our media and communication industries.
                  With three semesters of in-class, lab, studio / field learning, this programme is both rigorous as well as paced strategically to let you learn and contribute. </p>
                <p>It will have two mandatory internships—one in the social sector and another in the industry. A third internship can also be arranged at the end of your tenure in lieu of a job. Internships may be within the India Today Group / TV Today Network or outside of it, appropriate to your interest and aspirations.</p>
                <p><strong>Academic Approach:</strong> The two-year programme comprehensively grounds you in concepts and prepares you for a rewarding career in communication practice or research. Our endeavour will be to prepare you to be independent thinkers and self-starting professionals in the demanding and exciting world of the media and allied industries. This means that learning the tools, techniques and technology is only a preliminary surface of what you will learn. Beyond the usual, we will guide you to explore concepts and discover new paradigms in the way that your world of communication will function in future. </p>
                <p>The methodology we employ is largely founded on the innovative approaches we have designed and implemented, whereby learning follows hard work, smart thinking, and a 360-degree approach to understanding the world around you.</p>
                <p><strong>Academic input:</strong> Research-based projects, independent work, internships, practical and field work—often self-inspired and approved by us, and sometimes in far-flung areas—will form the crux of your academic plan at ITMI. Our programme places a high level of credence to your output based on the input you received; therefore, assessment will always be continuous and based on your understanding—not on reproduction of notes. A final research project is required.</p>
                <p><strong>Internship and placement: </strong>Arguably the biggest differentiator between a trainee and a professional is industry interface, and the most time you will spend in the industry while still a trainee is at your internship. You will have three internships, in different settings. Of the three internships, one is in the social sector, while the second will be within the India Today Group (including channels, digital content and marketing, e-commerce, marketing, sales, events, magazines, etc.). The final, longer, job-oriented internship will be industry-wide within your chosen stream. The institute will assist you in every way on internships. In the normal course, internships should be obtainable.</p>
                <p>A Placement Committee is constituted to assist you in securing job offers. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring you’re employable. Because ITMI is a professional institute, our focus in on your employability. </p>
                <p>All eligible candidates are assured placement opportunities.</p>
                <p><strong>Collaborations: </strong>We have ongoing and planned strategic, academic and research collaborations with several international governments and universities, development agencies, and media & communication firms and companies to give you the widest, richest and most global possible spectrum of academic, professional, cultural and communicative learning and hands-on experience.</p>
