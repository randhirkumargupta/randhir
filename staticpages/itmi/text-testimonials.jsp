Making a transition from Engineering to Media studies was never easy for me. I was scared and doubted my self. I was warned beforehand that training was going to be robust and rigorous. But, first day into Institute and I was asked to let go of my inhibitions and be crazy. Yes, this place gave me the freedom to express my self, made me push my limits, face my fears and allow me to be 'me'. From mentors to my fellow ITMIANS, everyone helped me grow from strength to strength. Today I look back and cherish every single day I spent here. Thank you ITMI. Miss You!   </p>

चैनल मतलब आजतक और इंस्टीट्यूट मतलब ITMI.. किसी के करियर की इससे अच्छी शुरुआत नहीं हो सकती.. अबतक के अपने छोटे से करियर में मैनें रिर्पोटिंग की.. एंकरिंग की.. वेबसाइट के लिए काम किया.. और इतने बड़े नेटवर्क में अपना हर सपना पूरा किया.. और ये मुमकिन सिर्फ इसलिए हो पाया क्योंकि मैं ITMI की स्टूडेंट थी.. आपको यहां शून्य से शिखर तक पहुंचना सिखाया जाता है, वो भी ठीक वैसे ही जैसे किसी छोटे बच्चे को शिक्षा मिलती है </p>

ITMI will teach you to follow the right track of journalism which has somewhat become dusty in today's world. Subjects are taught here on experience rather than fat books. The fascinating part is, one gets to meet the top-notch journalists from the industry sharing their own hands on experience and fanning out their views. </p>

Being someone who had no past educational qualifications in journalism and media never took a toll on my studies in TVTMI, such is the level of training and teaching in the institute. Faculties and facilities provided are exactly what a fresher needs to achieve endeavours in his or her journey in the industry. The way students are sent to newsroom is one of its kind training program. It not only trains us to handle all the domains of a media organisation but also makes us an all rounder media professional, the need of the hour! </p>

       <p>I was already a graduate in mass communication when I applied. Armed with theoretical knowledge, I was looking for a established platform that would provide me with lots of practical exposure. Now I am so glad I chose this institute: It not only grounded my journalistic skills, but also gave a great head start to my career.</p>

       <p>I remember when I was in final year graduation, a crew from Aaj Tak had visited our college to shoot a programme on campus life. I was a student participant then. Exactly 14 months later, I became the anchor of the show! It was a dream come true.</p>

       <p>मैं आज जो भी हूं वो ITMI की बदौलत हूं...ITMI ने मुझे पत्रकारिता की समझ दी। यही वो जगह है जहां मैं अपने आप को पहचान पाई, अपने करियर को दिशा दे पाई....वैसे सच कहूं तो जब भी पत्रकारिता की पहली क्लास यानी ITMI को याद करती हूं तो भावुक हो जाती हूं।
</p>
       <p>मुझे इस मुक़ाम तक पहुंचाने के लिए मैं टीवी टुडे मीडिया इंस्टिट्युट, आलोक सर, सुमित सिंघल सर और हमारी सबसे प्यारी नीलम मैम का दिल से आभार व्यक्त करती हूं।

       <p>Media is a profession which requires not a very different method of training, and this is where ITMI scores over any other media institute in the country. This institute aims at churning out professionals who are capable of handling various aspects of TV journalism: From script writing to facing and handling the camera and edit machines. We had a good mix of theoretical and practical classes with the best minds of news industry. We got huge amounts of exposure working in the newsrooms of Aaj Tak and Headlines Today through practical training there.</p>
       <p>ITMI offers an extremely comprehensive course that helps students find good jobs across channels. The training provided by my institute and subsequent work proved beneficial at another prestigious organization where I am working now.<br />
As Mr. Aroon Purie often says, "You are as good as your last story." India Today Media Institute aims at moulding young minds in a manner that they are capable of telling good, unbiased and balanced stories.
</p>
<p>With best wishes for all future endeavours.</p>
