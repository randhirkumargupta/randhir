            <p></p>
            <p>SURPRISE YOURSELF!</p>
            <p>Dear prospective applicant,</p>
            <p>It's great to belong to one of the biggest  media conglomerates in India,  because few people truly understand and appreciate the need for quality  education in communication as those who communicate for a living. The success  of our institute, reflected in the quality and levels of employment, owes itself for the most part to our uncompromising-if exacting-standards of input. </p>
            <p>This year we will have both the excitement  and the challenge of expanding our horizons beyond our much-proven success.  What started as a broadcast journalism institute will now be a full-fledged  communication institute.</p>
            <p>If you think you'll make a good  communicator read section "<a href="why-choose-communication.jsp" target="_self" style="text-decoration:underline">Why Choose Communication?</a>", you're in good company. The growth at 12%-by the M&amp;E industry remains way higher than average. This  should be music to your ears, as you aspire to be a part of this industry. The  growth will sustain over a long term, so that provides further optimism.</p>
            <p>Most of you will agree that there remains  so much to be done in media! Since 1992 when the media was liberalized, we have  been grappling with our function in the society. Today, we have  distinguished between information, education and entertainment, but the aspiration  of the first two towards the third remains. Such flux is not a bad thing, but  it requires thinking minds-visionaries-to intervene.</p>
            <p>What, then, will catalyze you? We believe  it is independent thought and, stemming from it, responsible action. Independent, critical thinking is a  result of the ability to analyse the world around, and we will train you in  that direction. But implementation is key, and that too, in a globally  competitive arena. Competitiveness and entrepreneurship, too, will be major drivers  of your success. An interdisciplinary approach to pedagogy is badly needed in  our country, and we will pioneer it. Most of all, you should take full  advantage of the excellent resources our group boasts of-some of the biggest  names in the industry who are always ready to guide you, state-of-the-art  technology, and international recognition. </p>
            <p>This is why that industry beckons youâ€”not  merely to join the bandwagon but to learn the ropes enough to make a positive  change in the industry.</p>
            <p>Come, discover what you can do and we'll help  you make a difference. You'll be surprised how much you can contribute.</p>
            <p>Chase  a dream. Discover yourself. Surprise yourself.</p>
