            <p></p>
            <p>PROF SHASHIDHAR NANJUNDAIAH, DEAN</p>
            <p>Prof Nanjundaiah is best known for his  efforts to improve curricular input methodologies in communication education. A  media veteran who pioneered the idea of interdisciplinary education in  communication, Prof Nanjundaiah believes that the methodology of curricular  input holds the key to successful learning. </p>
            <p>Prof Nanjundaiah has an MS (1995) in  Communication from Radford and Texas    A&amp;M Universities, USA,  an MA (1990) and BSc (1983) from the University of Mysore, India.</p>
            <p>He joined Symbiosis Institute of Mass  Communication as Director at a time (2001) when our media were poised for a  major takeoff. During his tenure, Prof Nanjundaiah initiated many development  and curricular measures that are considered benchmarks around the country even  today. When he was invited later to start up the Indira School of  Communication, no one anticipated the institute to be accorded the huge success  that it became in a short period, attributable to forward-looking, academically  embedded but highly marketable methods such as an interdisciplinary approach.  Trainees from the first batch received 100% placements, including some in  prestigious media organizations overseas.</p>
            <p> Prof Nanjundaiah has also held senior  positions in newspapers (including <em>The  Indian Express</em>), business magazines and television (Zee, Business India TV)  in India and the USA.  He has published articles in international journals and research books, is a  sought-after speaker at conferences and   a prolific writer on business domains.</p>
