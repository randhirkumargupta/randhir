      At a time when India had a total of 250 computers, Shiv Nadar led a young team of eight which passionately believed in the growth of the IT industry. That vision in 1976, born out of a Delhi “barsaati” has resulted now in a global transformational technology enterprise. Today, HCL is a $6.2-billion global enterprise with over 88,000 professionals from diverse nationalities, who operate from 31 countries including over 500 points of presence in India.<br />
<br />
At a time when hardware was the name of the game, Shiv Nadar foresaw the huge potential in IT education and learning. This resulted in the birth of NIIT. Shiv Nadar was conferred the Padma Bhushan - the third highest civilian honor, awarded by the President of India in recognition of not just his contribution to trade & industry in India, but also his deep commitment to public good.<br />

He is an active member of the Executive Board of the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad. Recently, he was appointed the Chairman, Board of Governors, IIT Kharagpur by the President of India. </div>
