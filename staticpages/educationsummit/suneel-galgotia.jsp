                        Suneel Galgotia’s family’s deep involvement with books and education, began in the 1930s, in Connaught Place, New Delhi, with a retail outlet for books, under the marquee of E.D. Galgotia and Sons. Suneel Galgotia finished his education at St. Columba’s School and Shri Ram College of Commerce and with Rs. 500 in his pocket, began his quest for serious entrepreneurship in the early 1980s with a publishing venture.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the nascent computer boom and used the then new technology to progressively leap-frog the business – first with Indian authors and later with foreign authors and publishers. 
From there, a venture into education was natural progression and he began Galgotias Institute of Management & Technology (GIMT) in 2000 with just 40 students. Galgotias Educational Institutions has moved on to include Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology (GCET) and Galgotias Business School (GBS). Today GCET alone has over 4,500 students
