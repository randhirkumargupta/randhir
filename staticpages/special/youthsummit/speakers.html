<div class="inside-text2"><img id="dyn_img_gallery" src="images/Vishwanathan-Anand_120.jpg" style="float: left;" height="110" align="middle" border="1" width="120">The six-year-old who was taught chess by his mother has become world champion in all three formats of the game, leaping over incipient racism, rampant politics and lack of systemic support. Overcoming the 1995 and 1998 losses of the world chess championships, he motivated himself into becoming the first Asian to win the tournament in 2000 and then undisputed champion in 2007. Building a team in the cut-throat universe of competitive chess, choosing to live in Spain, and maintaining his equilibrium in the face of dizzying success, he has transformed into a one man chess revolution. He has won rapid chess events against computers, as well as classical chess tournaments. With lightning speed, on-board intuition and the ability to read the game ahead of everyone else, he has left his stamp on a world hitherto dominated by the West. The youngest Indian to win the international master's title at 15 in 1984, he's been playing at the top of his game for the past 26 years.</div>

Whether it is changing the mindset of the villagers towards the<strong> Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme</strong>, or towards women, Rajawat is bringing her precise management principles to the often chaotic world of grassroots politics. She also looks after a hotel that the family owns in Jaipur and the numerous horses that are part of her riding school.</div>

With reason. At 29, the PhD student at MIT's Media Lab has patented <strong>Sixth Sense</strong>, a wearable device that enables new interactions between the real world and the world of data. He has also invented<strong> Intelligent Sticky Notes</strong> that can be searched and can send reminders; a Pen that draws in 3D; and TaPuMa, a tangible public map that can act as the Google of the physical world. Winner of the 2009 Invention Award from Popular Science and of the Young Innovator Award from Technology Review, his work has brought him a lot of media attention. Harnessing the best of both worlds--he holds a Master in Media Arts and Sciences from MIT and Master of Design from IIT Bombay--Mistry has also invented a designation for himself: a <strong>Designeer,</strong> who believes the imagination is the only limit in merging technology with real lifel.</div>

One of India's most successful sports leaders, he won 21 of his 49 Tests matches, took India to a World Cup final and was the core of an Indian team that began winning matches and series away from home. A stylish batsman, Dada, as he is fondly known, has shown the same grit in his individual career. The fourth-highest Indian Test batsman just behind the pantheon of Tendulkar, Dravid and Gavaskar, Ganguly is also ranked among the top five run scorers in the limited overs game, scoring 11,363 runs with 22 centuries in one day internationals. He has never been far from controversy, with long absences from the field and equally determined comebacks. And one of the most enduring popular images of the resurgence of Indian cricket in the time of television, is Ganguly brandishing his team shirt after winning the Natwest Trophy in Lords in 2002.</div>

From the negative role in Race to that of a serious politician in her recent film<em> Rajneeti,</em> she has even won over the critics.
