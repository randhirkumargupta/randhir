          Nandan Nilekani is one of the brightest minds in India today. A man of ideas and idealism, of courage and common sense, of technological brilliance and intellectual honesty, he is one of the founders of Infosys, which redefined not just how young Indians saw their careers but also how the world saw India. Not just as a land of silly superstitions and hidebound traditions, but of smart youngsters who could sell to America the idea of getting work done more efficiently and more inexpensively outside their country. The job demanded not just someone who could understand technology but also someone who could articulate it to the world.
            <p>Nandan is one of the architects of liberalised India. At 55, he is also a fine example of India's growth story. He was born in Bangalore where he spent the first 12 years of his life but he lived for many years in the small Karnataka town of Dharwad. Being a bright student he, inevitably, went to an IIT. </p>
            <p>There he realised what he was good at-apart from electrical engineering. It was organising things. He became General Secretary of the IIT, which would stand him in good stead for his eventual leap to the top, as the CEO who succeeded NR Narayanamurthy at Infosys between 2002 and 2007. Nandan's career exemplifies the other great aspect of India's growth story. The ability to take risks. It's that quality which made him follow Narayanamurthy when he quit Patni Computers in 1981, where he started at a salary of Rs 1,200, and set up Infosys in co-founder N S Raghavan's house in Matunga, northcentral Mumbai. </p>
            <p>There were seven people. They had no money, no connections, and a pledge to never foster corruption. And in a climate of an unliberalised India, they made a world class company which is respected the world over.</p>
            <p>Infosys to a great extent made it possible largely because they saw an opportunity in a crisis. When the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, several cost-slashing US companies began shifting software development and back-office work to India, with its low wages and educated workforce. Between 1999 and 2004, Infosys' revenues grew, now to over Rs 22,000 crore, and it today employs over 110,000 lakh people in 63 offices across the world. </p>
            <p>It was the first Indian company to be listed on the New York stock exchange. Infosys was India's really first global giant, with more than 90 per cent of its annual revenues coming from overseas. It set the standards for corporate governance in India and a remarkable example of succession planning. </p>
            <p>The most difficult act in the world is for successful founders to give up their jobs.</p>
            <p>They have had three CEOs, including Nandan. Ofcourse, they had handsome stock options which has made Nandan a very rich man, but he doesn't think it should be spent on pricey toys and pretty palaces. </p>
            <p>Nandan has always thought beyond his own corporation, where he spent an extraordinary 28 years. He is one of the youngest entrepreneurs to join 20 global leaders on the prestigious World Economic Forum (WEF) Foundation Board. He co-founded NASSCOM as well as the Bangalore Chapter of The IndUS Entrepreneurs (TiE). He is a member of the Board of Governors of the IIT Bombay and is also a member of the review committee of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. </p>
            <p>His quiet work in philanthropy, whether it is giving to his alma mater or to the think tank, the New India Foundation, also marks him out as a man of vision.</p>
            <p>Here is an Indian who had the courage to imagine a renewed nation even when he was sharing a scooter with co-founder S.D. Shibulal as they would drive around Bangalore looking for business. Having put India on the map of the world, he is now mapping India as the chairman of the National Unique Identification Development Authority of India on the request of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh though he could have well stayed on at Infosys. He may have skeptics in this task as well, but then Nandan Nilekani has spent many years showing how anything is possible. Even that the world is flat.</p>
            <p>I got to know Nandan a few years back in Davos and seen him enthrall people there. But more importantly, his wife Rohini worked as a journalist before her marriage for a city magazine called Bombay which was part of our group. And now she does great social work. </p>
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot think of a better man to begin our first ever Youth Summit with. Nandan Nilekani, the man whom Thomas Friedman called the Great Explainer, on how to Dream Big and Do Bigger.</p>

But our young men &amp; women could turn around and ask: &ldquo;What are you doing for us? To expose us to new ideas, to charge us with the self confidence we need to face life, to show us the road to maximum achievement?&rdquo;
              <p>At<strong> India Today</strong> we decided to put our effort where our heart is and so we bring you our latest venture: the<strong> India Today Youth Summit</strong>, which we hope will become an annual date to remember. The aim of this daylong event is to give young people the unique opportunity to interface with their Icons --- Achievers who have struggled, overcome and today are acknowledged leaders in their fields. Come, listen to them and be inspired by them as they recount their unique experiences and give you their <strong>Mantras of Success</strong>.&quot;. </p>
