          Nandan Nilekani has a simple mantra for success -- think big, raise your aspirations and work towards your goal with relentless focus. Inaugurating India Today's Youth Summit on Saturday, co-founder of Infosys and chairman of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) Nilekani said that since thinking big and thinking small took the same amount of time, then why not think big.
            <p>He gave credit to this mantra for his own success. Talking about his life, which he called a ''series of happy accidents,'' he said that at a time when the company he founded along with his mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy, was facing an existential crisis in the 90s when global companies started venturing into India, they had an option to either shut down, sell the company or go bigger. ''We decided to think big and expand. It is all about unlocking our imagination and freeing our mind. In 1999, Infosys listed on Nasdaq. When we realised we needed good work force, we set-up a world class campus in Mysore in 2000, followed by a leadership academy,'' said Nilekani.</p>
            <p>Emphasising on the need for harnessing the power of youth, he said that their company had hugely benefited from youth with the average age at Infosys being 27 years.</p>
            <p>He said that it was extremely important for India to reap the benefits of the demographic dividend that it enjoyed. ''India is a young country in an ageing world. We can fully realise the potential it gives us only by giving opportunities to the youth,'' he said.<br>
              In fact, in response to a question by a young man in the audience about outsourcing, Nilekani said that it was important for the youth to be a part of the global world. It would be more beneficial for the Indian youth to contribute to the world by being a part of either the manufacturing industry, catering to other countries, or outsourcing. ''We have to be a part of the global economy and take advantage of the demographic dividend,'' he stressed.</p>
            <p>              One year in the government as head of the UIDAI, Nilekani seems to have mastered the art of dealing with the red-tapism, usually associated with government functioning. He said that the trick was not to worry about small things but to remain focused on a few big issues. ''It is not easy to get a bigger car in government but it is easy to get a financial sanction for an important project. The government is more receptive to big ideas,'' he said.</p>
            <p>              Nilekani also dismissed the notion that Infosys had grown since the government did not breathe down their necks. ''In fact, the government played a large role in growth and success of the company and the country. The government set up IT parks, gave tax holidays and made import of equipment customs duty-free. We all benefited from that. Jawaharlal Nehru set up IITs in 1957 and I went there and succeeded.'' he said, trying to put the government's role in the right perspective.</p>
            <p>Agreeing to take up Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's offer to give identity cards to the people of the country, he said it was his way of paying back to the country what he had gained. The UID cards, he said, to begin with will benefit the poor and the marginalised sections of the society, bringing them into the mainstream and enable them to benefit from various social and economic schemes of the government, be it NREGA or to access bank accounts or even own a cell phone. He talked about the concept of business correspondent, proposed by RBI, whereby a local kirana shop or any other chosen person will function as a micro ATM. A villager or farmer, who does not have access to a bank branch in his neighbourhood, can approach the business correspondent and withdraw money from his account. His UID number will help him in that.</p>
            <p>''This is what is driving me and my team now -- to unlock the ability of the poor and the marginalised to enter the mainstream. A big goal, whether personal or social, energises and gives a sense of purpose. Have a goal and work towards it. That's how you get on in life,'' Nilekani said.<br>

But our young men &amp; women could turn around and ask: &ldquo;What are you doing for us? To expose us to new ideas, to charge us with the self confidence we need to face life, to show us the road to maximum achievement?&rdquo;
              <p>At<strong> India Today</strong> we decided to put our effort where our heart is and so we bring you our latest venture: the<strong> India Today Youth Summit</strong>, which we hope will become an annual date to remember. The aim of this daylong event is to give young people the unique opportunity to interface with their Icons --- Achievers who have struggled, overcome and today are acknowledged leaders in their fields. Come, listen to them and be inspired by them as they recount their unique experiences and give you their <strong>Mantras of Success</strong>.&quot;. </p>
