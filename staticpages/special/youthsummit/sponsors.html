But our young men &amp; women could turn around and ask: &ldquo;What are you doing for us? To expose us to new ideas, to charge us with the self confidence we need to face life, to show us the road to maximum achievement?&rdquo;
              <p>At<strong> India Today</strong> we decided to put our effort where our heart is and so we bring you our latest venture: the <strong>India Today Youth Summit</strong>, which we hope will become an annual date to remember. The aim of this daylong event is to give young people the unique opportunity to interface with their Icons --- Achievers who have struggled, overcome and today are acknowledged leaders in their fields. Come, listen to them and be inspired by them as they recount their unique experiences and give you their <strong>Mantras of Success</strong>.&quot;</p>
