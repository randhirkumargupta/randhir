          Do what your heart says and the rest will follow was the message that rang out loud and clear at the Believe in Yourself session of the India Today Youth Summit 2010.
          <p>Chhavi Rajawat, corporate executive-turned-Sarpanch of Rajasthan's Soda village, was the first of the four successful professionals to address the overwhelmingly youthful audience.&quot; </p>
            <p>Drawing on her experience as the elected head of her village, Rajawat said it is also essential to believe in the innate goodness of people; it's an adjunct to belief in oneself, she stressed.&quot;</p>
            <p>She described her efforts to ensure development of her village as a battle against mostly uninterested and insincere government agencies. Water is the single biggest problem in her village, Rajawat told the packed hall at the Janakpuri Hilton here. She went on to relate how her efforts to raise resources to help resolve this perennial crisis in Soda met with no government aid and that she had to organise the money herself, leaning on her family and friends. The problem is far from over, but Rajawat said she's not giving up.&quot;. </p>
            <p>Rajawat wrapped up her speech by making a case for the freedom of panchayats to use their funds as they deem fit. "Everybody has problems; we tend to crib and do nothing," she adding, "It's time we stood up together and created a wave that will bring progress to rural India."</p>
			<p>Mukul  Deora, entrepreneur, musician and installation artist, was next. He built his speech around a George Bernard Shaw quote: The reasonable man adapts to his surroundings, the unreasonable man adapts his surroundings to himself; therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</p>
			<p>Describing youth as energy without direction, he related his life journey from the ups and downs of his first foray into business to a musician to a real estate developer. The journey is the important thing, Deora said, summing up his philosophy by saying that the Shaw quote works only "when you know your core values and ideals".
    Sanjeev Sanyal, president and founder of the Sustainable Planet Institute, was next and he developed the concept of the unreasonable man further.</p>
			<p>Underlining his theme with examples from the successes and failures of his life, Sanyal pointed out that there is a "dumb side to being unreasonable". He made a strong case for not looking at economic growth through the limited perspective of the GDP. Sanyal then described how he and a colleague had devised an alternative method of measuring economic progress, stressing how one needs to take the cost to the environment into account. He then went on to talk about the growing urbanisation of India, saying it was the biggest thing happening in our lives and that precious little attention was being paid to it.</p>
			<p>Engineer-turned-scriptwriter Jaideep Sahni was the showstealer, however, with his mix of candour and spontaneity riveting the attention of all present to his words. Sahni spoke of his journey from school to engineering college to advertising to films, his sharp wit bringing alive the futility of chasing success that most people's lives turn into.</p>
			<p>He spoke of doing what one's heart wants, and of the inevitability of that being useful to someone, rather than chasing the mirage of success. The latter, he said, "would ensure that half of your salary is spent on antacids." Sahni's easygoing manner involved the audience from his first word to the last, as he took them effortlessly through his definition and comprehension of following one's heart. </p>

But our young men &amp; women could turn around and ask: &ldquo;What are you doing for us? To expose us to new ideas, to charge us with the self confidence we need to face life, to show us the road to maximum achievement?&rdquo;
              <p>At<strong> India Today</strong> we decided to put our effort where our heart is and so we bring you our latest venture: the<strong> India Today Youth Summit</strong>, which we hope will become an annual date to remember. The aim of this daylong event is to give young people the unique opportunity to interface with their Icons --- Achievers who have struggled, overcome and today are acknowledged leaders in their fields. Come, listen to them and be inspired by them as they recount their unique experiences and give you their <strong>Mantras of Success</strong>.&quot;. </p>
