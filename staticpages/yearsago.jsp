The hike in overall exports from about Rs 104 crore in 1971-72 to over Rs 313 crore in 1976-77, with a target of about Rs 365 crore for the current fiscal year, is a tremendous achievement.<br><br>Atraditional exporter of raw hides and skins stated that the industry has now transformed itself into a supplier of sophisticated processed leathers, footwear and other goods to several transnational markets. In fact, the transition through different stages on the export front-raw hides, semiprocessed categories and finished leathers-has been remarkably fast.<br><br>Not long ago, overseas sales of raw hides and skins were banned to promote higher exports of semi-finished varieties like wet blue and East India leathers. A few years back, the government stepped in again and imposed quotas on dispatches of semi-finished types abroad in a bid to boost export of finished leathers. This policy decision set off a flurry of protests and controversies. The argument of the industry was that it was not prepared for the switchover to production of finished leathers in a signifcant way in the absence of modern equipment, adequate finance and necessary auxiliaries (chemicals).</p><p><b>By Hubschber&nbsp;</b> <br></p>';

The latest flap is the Budget bombshell-the straight 10 per cent ad valorem excise slapped onto film production to their proportionate costs. "With a hammer, the Union Finance Ministry has given ad valorem a completely deadly twist," moaned a special edition of &rsquo;Trade Guide&rsquo;, the industry&rsquo;s official public relations organ, on June 21. This wouldn&rsquo;t have been funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so serious a matter. The film industry has been agitating for precisely an ad valorem type of excise. Previously the levy rate operated along preferential taxation. Motion picture prints of any picture up to the first 12 prints were free of taxation. In 1976, 530 films were released, out of which 416 were regional films (78 per cent); 254 out of these 416 films did not pay any levy at all under the old taxation system. Again, 114 Hindi films released last year did not pay any levy for the first 12 prints or for overseas prints. Now, all the films, Hindi or regional, will come under the tax net and there is a distinct possibility of regional cinema dying under the new system.<br><br><b>By Ashok Row Kavi</b>';

The "good" part of it received instant notice, but soonalmost everyone was found holding his nose.The hungriest clamour was for the so-called relaxation of credit curbs. A persistent campaign had been mounted by the chambers of commerce and even spokesmenof financial institutions against what they called the adverse effects of the credit freeze, imposed by the erstwhile government, for curbing inflationary pressures. They were happy to note that the ceiling on the rate of interest on term loans has now been brought down to 12.50 per cent from 14.15 per cent. Even as industrial circles took added comfort from the fact that banks have been told, though not by specific directive,to pass on the benefit of interest saving on deposits to borrowers particularly in the priority sectors, several popular countersat the Bombay Stock Exchange recorded sizeable gains. Most of these shares have since maintained their upward movement. But a feeling is gradually growing that the stock market has perhaps over-reacted. The new credit policy has, after all, tightened the screws on the availability of credit even while reducing its cost.</p><p><b>By Mohan Rao</b>&nbsp;</p>';

In this new game of numbers called the restructuring of education, what is in danger of being forgotten is the crux of the problem.<br><br>What is important is not how many years a child spends at school and college in one or two or three stages, but what and how he learns during that time. Everyone seems to agree that the education system needs to be overhauled. Unfortunately, the great debate in the restructuring of education seems to be centring around irrelevancies like whether a child should spend 10, 11 or 12 years at school, whether this should be in one or two stages and finally whether at college the average student should spend two or three years getting his bachelor&rsquo;s degree.<br><br>Few seem to be worried about modernising curricula or introducing a new approach to education, an approach in which the teacher should learn to draw out the student instead of pumping him with information. Discussions on curricula also tend to centre around the width and breadth of the subject to be &rsquo;covered&rsquo; instead of worrying about how a subject is to be taught. In the last few weeks, thousands of children all over the country have appeared for the first time for the Class X examination which was introduced under the new pattern of education by the previous government.</p><p><b>By </b><b>Neena Vyas</b></p>';

Instead , he went over to Kashmir, lived there for some time, died a natural death and is buried in Rauza Bal, Khanyar, a densely populated area in the interior of the city of Srinagar.<br><br>Intrigued by this myth, a large number of foreigners have begun to visit this tomb. This theory was first pronounced by Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Qadiyani (1835-1906), the founder of the Ahmediya sect in India, in his controversial Urdu book Maseeh Hindustan Main (Jesus in India) published in 1899. He challenged the established belief regarding the death of Christ. The theory was elaborated further by Mirza Qadiyani&rsquo;s followers like Mufti Sadiq (The Grave of Jesus-1936), Khwaja Nazir Ahmed (Jesus in the Heaven of Earth-1951) and Maulana Jalaluddin Shams, ex-Imam of London Mosque (Where did Jesus Die? 1959). Nevertheless, the theory has not been proved beyond an iota of doubt. It could only be done with the support of authentic historical evidence. <br><br>The Ahmediyas believe that their religious head, Mirja Qadiyani, was the Maseeh-e-Mauood (the reincarnated Jesus), who was reborn in India 18 centuries after the death of Jesus-who had also died in the sub-continent. Obviously, they seem to be keen in making the world believe that Jesus died in Kashmir and was reborn as Mirza-e-Qadian in Qadian, near Amritsar. <br><br><b>By Ghulam Nabi Khayal</b>';

This was done under pressure from some political bosses, who allegedly included the son and son-in-law of Bansi Lal, then defence minister, and former Haryana chief minister B.D. Gupta. <br><br>The quantum of loss to the exchequer may be gauged from the fact that the open auction of quarrying rights on April 14 this year has netted a sum of Rs 4.77 lakh as against Rs 2.50 lakh earned through the "permit" system in 1976-77. <br><br>Interestingly, the present auction confers quarrying rights for two and a half months only in 26 villages, while the Emergency "permits" were valid for 12 months and extended the rights to about 55 villages along the Ghaggar belt. It would not be unreasonable to believe that the extracted quantity of stones is far in excess of what is shown in the permits. This fact can be verified from the stone crushers who are registered dealers and income tax payees. It can be further cross-checked with relevant entries at the Haryana sales tax barriers where every outgoing truck loaded with bajri is recorded in the sales tax form number 24.<br><br><i>By S. P.

For instance, he decides one day that he must grow a beard, that he will not shave: It is a protest against the treatment meted out to prisoners during the Emergency. So there he is with a long unkempt beard at the end of his jail term. He shaves it off with great gusto outside an ashram a few days after he is made a minister.

With six steel plants, India had until last year a saleable steel capacity of about 6.9 million tonnes. Of these, TISCO and the Russian-aided Bhilai had been producing satisfactorily to their capacity. But the main problem had been the British-assisted Durgapur plant which had not been producing even half of its capacity because of labour and other problems.

Even the most imaginative painter, if his work carries with it a sense of conviction, can lift us into his world of fantasies. Akbar Padamsee has been well established for at least two generations, with studios in both Bombay and Paris. He paints landscapes. And he paints them with a particular kind of all-embracing totality that sees neither the real nor the imaginary, but the all-together. It is a conceptual approach certainly, but one that heightens and enlarges our experience of a landscape. Recently the Gallery Pundole in Bombay ran a show of his canvases. In the last four years, since he won the Nehru fellowship, he figured in the art world largely as an intellectual, when he ran a studio that offered amenities to fellow artists, experimented in the film medium, dabbled in Sanskrit and generally expanded his capabilities. When he painted again, he returned to a more clarified but expansive vision of his earlier work.</p><p><i>-&nbsp;by Geeti Sen</i></p>';

It is a fatuous comment as every place has a history of its own; whether or not it is of relevance or interest to the visitor is another matter. What is fascinating, however, is a place which has played a major role in shaping particular historical events and which continues to display those attributes in the course of today&rsquo;s affairs. Darra, in Pakistan&rsquo;s rugged North West Frontier Province, is precisely such a place. At first glance, Darra, situated close to Kohat Pass some 40 km from Peshawar, looks like any other prosperous settlement in the Pathan tribal belt which spans the Pakistan/Afghanistan border. That is until it becomes clear that an inordinate number of shops are selling guns and the occasional explosions heard coming from the back streets are not old jalopies backfiring but test rounds being fired from small arms. Darra, in fact, is less of a village and more of a fullscale munitions factory.</p>';

Indira Gandhi, who last fortnight spent the 250th day of her third tenure as prime minister, sits at the head of a government that appears to have been seized by an inexplicable paralysis, as though frozen into a statue by the evil glance of a Medusa. She attends office , clears files, cuts ribbons, makes speeches, acts correctly with foreign dignitaries, dresses appropriately, obliges children, photographers and newsmen with smiling appearances and vacuous interviews. Business as usual at a first glance. But it looks certain that the mystique around her, which is shattered, cannot be repaired by "all the king&rsquo;s horses and all the king&rsquo;s men".

Each shack is about 10 ft by 12 ft. Inside is a tightly-packed jigsaw puzzle of cots, seven in all. One corner of the shack has been converted into makeshift kitchen--a soot blackened kerosene stove, some aluminium pots and pans and a row of Dalda tins and packets of Pakistani spices take up the space. A narrow path meanders between the beds. The flimsy walls of the shack reveal the nationality of the occupants--they display cheap, garish pin-ups of busty south Indian stars. On one wall, Hema Malini and Zeenat Aman flank a calendar portraying Guru Nanak. And, perched incongruously alongside a row of scented hair oil bottles, is an empty case of Buchanan&rsquo;s Scotch Whisky.</p><p align="right"><b>--by Dilip Bobb</b></p>';

The first stage of the Jagmohan-Goenka battle centred around that all-too-familiar ploy--the press conference. On March 1, barely a fortnight after his political rebirth, Jagmohan announced that an inquiry into the construction of the new building of the <i>Indian Express</i> had been set in motion "following complaints that extra space was sanctioned for the building by the Janata Government in total disregard of the master plan, zonal regulations and municipal by-laws".

The hike in overall exports from about Rs 104 crore in 1971-72 to over Rs 313 crore in 1976-77, with a target of about Rs 365 crore for the current fiscal year, is a tremendous achievement.<br><br>Atraditional exporter of raw hides and skins stated that the industry has now transformed itself into a supplier of sophisticated processed leathers, footwear and other goods to several transnational markets. In fact, the transition through different stages on the export front-raw hides, semiprocessed categories and finished leathers-has been remarkably fast.<br><br>Not long ago, overseas sales of raw hides and skins were banned to promote higher exports of semi-finished varieties like wet blue and East India leathers. A few years back, the government stepped in again and imposed quotas on dispatches of semi-finished types abroad in a bid to boost export of finished leathers. This policy decision set off a flurry of protests and controversies. The argument of the industry was that it was not prepared for the switchover to production of finished leathers in a signifcant way in the absence of modern equipment, adequate finance and necessary auxiliaries (chemicals).</p><p><b>By Hubschber&nbsp;</b> <br></p></div></td></tr>
