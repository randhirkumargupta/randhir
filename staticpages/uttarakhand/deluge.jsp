</div>
						<p>Over Sunday and Monday, June 16-17, 2013, when a series of cloudbursts wreaked havoc in 5 districts of Rudraprayag, Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Pithoragarh and Tehri, there were nearly 12,000 people at Kedarnath and Gaurikund--the stretch that bore the brunt of the deluge. Ten days later, about 6,000 had been rescued from Kedarnath. More than 800 bodies were recovered in and around Kedarnath. Hundreds were reported missing.</p>
						<p class="wd">The cloudbursts led to flash floods that swept away mountainsides, villages, people, animals, houses, trucks, cars, roads... nothing escaped. Nothing survived, it had no hope of surviving.</p>
						<p class="wd">Those who survived it say they had never seen anything like this and hope that this was the first and last time they ever saw something like this. The trickle of water that was supposed to be the rain run-off had suddenly taken on immense proportions. The people in the Kedarnath valley were stuck-they had the mountains behind them and the flash flood in front of them.</p>

                        <p class="wd">The first of the cloudbursts--signalled by something that sounded like a sudden explosion that shook most of the houses--at Kedarnath took place around 7.30 pm on June 16. Within minutes, the area was full of people running towards the temple screaming <em>"bhago, bhago (run, run)"</em>. The check dam behind the temple crumbled and water gushed towards the temple. Nearly 250 people found shelter at the temple that night. With the temple almost full, the survivors spent the night standing in the temple's prayer hall. No one knew what was happening outside. All they knew, and that too from the ominous sound of the water hitting the temple walls, was that the township outside was being destroyed. The water kept rising inside the sanctum sanctorum that was already full of people. They hung on to whatever they could find. A man latched on to the bell, another to the chhatri. Some drowned, others floated.</p>
						<p class="wd">Those who were caught outside were picked up by the gushing waters and tossed around like matchsticks in a hurricane. The first images, as they poured in, showed bodies lying in twisted heaps all over the place--some of them barely recognisable as those of humans.</p>
						<p class="wd">Dawn broke. The survivors of that first night peeked out only to see that the entire area had been transformed into something that appeared to have been bombed time and again.</p>
						<p class="wd">But the worst was not over yet.</p>
						<p class="wd">A second cloudburst on the morning of June 17 made the Chorbadi Tal breach its walls. The massive amount of water released from the lake, combined with that of the incessant rain, flowed down and brought with it a massive mudslide that dislodged boulders and brought them down. All those structures that had withstood the previous night's onslaught perished under the sheer speed and weight of the water.</p>
						<p class="wd">The floodwaters weren't content with ravaging the town of Kedarnath. As it flowed downhill towards flat land, it went through nearly 200 villages with such terrifying speed that the villagers had little or no time to escape. The result: houses, two-three storey buildings came crashing down as the floodwaters washed away the earth they were standing on, people and livestock were no exceptions. Roads and bridges soon became part of the debris the water was carrying with it.</p>
						<p class="wd">Hotels and houses were crumbling and collapsing into the water, cars were thrown about like paper boats. Only the face of the giant Parmarth Shiva statue in Rishikesh was visible. The lord himself couldn't withstand the gush of the river that flows from his locks, as the stories go.</p>

                            	<h3>What is a Cloudburst?</h3>
                               A sudden, downpour over a limited area as if the entire clouds were to rain down in a matter of minutes. If it rains over a 100 mm in an hour concentrated in a area just a few square kilometres, one can call it a cloudburst. In Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag, it rained 479 mm in the intervening night of June 16-17. They are called cloudbursts because we earlier believed that clouds were a solid mass of water that burst over an area.
                               <h3>Why and how? </h3>
Cloudbursts occur because the warm air current from the ground or below the clouds rushes up and carries the falling raindrops up with it. The rain fails to fall down in a steady shower. This results in excessive condensation in the clouds as new drops form and old drops are pushed back into it by the updraft. Then one of them gives in. The air current slows down or the clouds can't hold. The resulting violent downpour can dump as much as 70,000 tonnes of water over an acre of land. In India, a cloudburst mostly occurs in the mountains of India where the low monsoon clouds are stopped by the high mountains. But it may happen elsewhere. On July 26, 2005, a cloudburst over Mumbai dumped 1,448 mm of rain in 10 hours. </div>

</div>
                      </div>
                        <p class="wd">If that wasn't enough, continuous rain caused landslides to block routes and come crashing on hapless survivors who had managed to escape the waters.</p>
						<p class="wd">The scale of devastation was felt two days later as relief teams reached Kedarnath. Those who were part of the first team say they will never forget the sight and the stench of rotting bodies. Except for the temple, everything was lost. Roads had been transformed into rocky paths, houses crushed to pulp, and bodies lay all over the place twisted into gruesome and humanly impossible positions. The same sight was visible in village after village ravaged by the deluge.</p>
						<p>According to Uttarakhand government report a total of more than 1 lakh people have been rescued till date. As many as 2,375 villages were cut-off from the rest of the world.<br />
	  </p>
						<p>Unconfirmed reports put the number of dead at 10,000--a figure which was immediately denied by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna who claimed that the actual figure was around 1,000.<br />
	  </p>
						<p class="wd">&nbsp;</p>
                        						<h3>The Blame Game</h3>
						<p class="wd">Even as the rescue and relief operations got underway, the state government, opposition and experts from various agencies began pointing fingers and giving explanations and theories of how the disaster could have been avoided.</p>
                        <p class="wd">The locals believe that it was the moving of the statue of Dhari Devi-an avatar of Kali-that led to the destruction. For centuries it has been believed that angering Dhari Devi will lead to destruction. Call it blind faith or superstition, their belief was avenged on June 16 soon after the idol of the goddess was uprooted from its ancient temple near Srinagar (Garhwal) for a hydel power project. Barely hours after the idol was moved, the first cloudburst took place.</p>
<p class="wd">Environmentalists say indiscriminate construction in the ecologically sensitive region is to be blamed for the widespread devastation that the state has witnessed. More than 500 dams have been cleared for construction on the Ganga and its tributaries--the Bhagirathi, the Mandakini and the Alaknanda. With around 95 per cent of the dams being built after the formation of the state in 2000, environmentalists warn that the worst is yet to come.</p>
<p class="wd">Environmentalists say the construction of dams, tunnels and roads which require blasting of hills is taking its toll on the local ecology as well. Due to the ensuing deforestation, trees are unable to absorb rainfall. With the state receiving high intensity rainfall, being prone to landslides and the state falling in a high seismic activity zone, the risk of disaster is increased manifold.</p>
<p class="wd">However, this argument died quietly a couple of days later, giving way to another argument: that the government was not prepared for something like this.</p>
<p class="wd">The blame game had begun. The state government run by Vijay Bahuguna, already stung by the devastation was driven on the back foot with no scope for defence. Bahuguna, responding to all those allegations, claimed that the met department's prediction was only for a heavy rainfall, a regular thing in the region, not a cloudburst.</p>
<p class="wd">But the problem is not in the fact that the met department failed to give a specific warning of a cloudburst. The problem lies in the government's serpentine and lackadaisical ways of functioning.</p>
<p class="wd">Amid all this finger pointing and name calling came unconfirmed news that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi had done a "Rambo" and rescued around 15,000 stranded Gujaratis.</p>
<p class="wd">And if that wasn't enough, politicians also came to blows at Dehradun's Jolly Grant airport over who would transport 200 tourists who had been rescued. Members of the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) had both booked flights to Andhra Pradesh for the evacuees. They fought over whose plane the tourists would use to go home. (The rescued tourists were finally divided and sent in both the planes!)</p>

						<p class="wd">Every time a major disaster takes place, the relief experts-the Army and Air Force-are called out. It was no different this time either. The first teams to break through and reach the survivors were the army teams.</p>
</div>

                        <p class="wd">The rescue teams had their own battles to fight-a non-cooperating weather, inhospitable terrain and survivors who had neither the heart nor the strength to go on. As the first of the survivors reached safety, the evacuees told horrific tales of how they had been robbed by locals-the security agencies recovered Rs 1.4 crore from three rescued sadhus who had apparently robbed the dead and living. How they had no food to eat and were asked to pay Rs 1,000 for a packet of biscuits that cost Rs 5. Stories of how chopper companies had demanded anything from Rs 6,000 to Rs 3 lakh to evacuate the stranded were also told. They narrated stories of how people were killed for their belongings. They told stories of how while walking to safety someone in the group-dehydrated and tired-just fell by the roadside and died. They told stories of sacrifices and of survival.</p>

                        <p class="wd">There were men who had the 1,000-yard stare in their eyes, but said nothing; what could they say-that they had lost their whole family to the floods? Little children sobbing quietly in corners-a two-year-old with fractures in both legs asking for her dead parents-told stories of how their parents had sacrificed themselves to ensure that their children lived.</p>
						<p class="wd">The Army and the Indian Air Force had their task cut out-rescue as many people as possible and restore a semblance of normality in the area. A daunting task considering the circumstances. The jawans did what they could-even giving up their lives to save those who were stranded. A chopper crash killed 20 people, all of them security personnel from various branches of the armed forces.</p>
						<p class="wd">Video and still image footage shows army men walking down the mountains carrying those who couldn't walk any further. Keeping to their mandate to save lives, the army jawans built Burma bridges, harnesses and lifted people from one point to another to get them to safety.</p>
                        <p class="wd">At the same time, the inclement weather conditions made things difficult. Continuous rain made the terrain even more treacherous. And if that wasn't enough, a 3.5 magnitude earthquake hit the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand on Thursday (June 27), spreading panic in the area.</p>
                        <p class="wd">The grim work continued. The deceased had to be given their last rites. And amid fears of the possibility of an epidemic, mass cremations were conducted but after proper prayers had been done.</p>

                          <h3>Back to Kedarnath</h3>
                    <p class="wd">No matter what happens, life has to return to normal. That is an eventuality and a law of nature that cannot be overthrown.</p>
						<p class="wd">The state government has a massive reconstruction and revival task ahead of it. In his own words, Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna has said that the scale of destruction is far too much for his state to manage on its own and that it will take more than three years for the state to return to normal.</p>
                        <p class="wd">For the state, it is not just a major setback in its plans to become one of the most preferred tourism locations; it is a regression into the past.</p>
                        <p class="wd">Building roads and other infrastructure will take some time, what will take the maximum time will be the rebuilding of lives and livelihoods of the locals who have lost everything they had built over the years. For the locals, it will be equally difficult to go on with their lives considering that many families, and in some cases whole villages, have lost their earning male population as well as the primary source of their income--tourism. More than anything else, it is this loss that they have to come to terms with and carry on with determination to honour their dead. More than the government, it is the locals who have to revive the state to what it was once and make it better.</p>

                        <p class="wd">The destruction and the lives lost should serve as a lesson for the state government to ensure that conditions are not created for a similar catastrophe. After all, it takes years to make a state prosperous, but just one raindrop is enough to cause a lake to overflow and cause wide-spread destruction.</p>
