Not only is it a marker of sexual trends,       it locates them within a wider cultural matrix. The survey looks at sexuality       not just as an intimate, deeply personal act between two (or more) individuals,       but also as a form of consumption. The questions it sets for itself always       seem enigmatic and impossible. In 2003, it tried to answer &quot;what do       women want&quot;. From men, marriage, life. In 2004, it surveyed men between       18 and 55, and tried to play the good doctor: is sex important? Do men care       about women? Do men consume pornography? Do they masturbate? The following       year, it was the single young woman, between 18 and 30, who caught India       Today's fancy, and her answers confirmed sociological suspicions: a sexual       revolution was afoot, sedately but surely. In 2006, it seems only logical       that the single young man is in focus. Who is this 16-25-year-old single       urban male, at the threshold of his career and the foothills of domesticity?       Is he prepared for the sensible young woman, who seems to understand her       priorities in the public space and private domain? How low is his emotional       quotient and how hot is his sexual chemistry? Is he as much a victim, as       the woman is, of cultural expectations and biological restrictions? Is he       regressive or liberal; confused or just careful; happy to embrace the shallow       benefits of shining modernity yet, unwilling to pay his dues?</p> </p> <br>      <br>      <table width="400" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" bgcolor="#E5E5E5">        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="400" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr bgcolor="#E5E5E5">           <td colspan="3" class="mediumtext" height="30"> <table width="400" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="2" align="center">              <tr>                 <td><span class="intro">SUMMING IT UP</span><br>                  <span class="tabledata">The India Today-AC Nielsen-ORG-MARG                   Sex Survey 2006 was done to understand the sexuality of the                   young Indian male. The survey was conducted among men in the                   age group of 16-25 to delve deeper into the sexuality of the                   unmarried man. We covered his sexual preferences and attitudes                   as also socio-cultural factors which help shape that attitude-his                   interaction with the opposite sex, his friends, his family and                   his economic behaviour. With a robust sample size of 2,559 males                   across 11 cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Lucknow,                   Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Patna, Ludhiana, Kolkata and Chennai), street-corner                   sampling was used to find respondents.

Take the distinction between the domestic universe and the public         peer group. The family controls who your wife is, while peer groups and         urban sites determine who your girlfriend is. In terms of introduction         to women, the peer group, trends, neighbourhood, and college score over         family. Family is a poor fifth as a trigger for introductions though it         is as high as 33 per cent for Chennai, 26 per cent for Hyderabad and 27         per cent for Bangalore. The Internet is nibbling its way in as a gigantic         meeting place, responsible as it is for 15 per cent of introductions in         Hyderabad and 16 per cent in Ahmedabad. Yet, when it comes to female friends         dropping in for a visit, the nays still dominate, Mumbai being the only         city bucking the trend.</p>      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="1" align="right" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr bgcolor="#E5E5E5">           <td colspan="3" class="mediumtext" height="30"> <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="2" align="center">              <tr>                 <td><span class="intro">SEX SURVEY: 16-25-YEAR-OLD SINGLE MEN</span></td>              </tr>            </table></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"> <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" align="center" bgcolor="e5e5e5">              <tr bgcolor="f0f0f0">                 <td class="smalltext"><p> <strong>Have you ever had sex?</strong></p>                  <p> YES - 46%<br>                    NO - 51%<br>                    Rest: Don't know/Can't say</p>                  <p> In 2005, in contrast, only 24 per cent single women between                     the ages of 18 and 30 in the India Today-AC Nielsen-ORG-MARG                     survey had had sex.</p>                  <p> <strong>At what age did you first have sex?</strong></p>                  <p> LESS THAN 15 YEARS - 11%<br>                    16-18 YEARS - 41%<br>                    18-21 YEARS - 36%<br>                    22-25 YEARS - 12%<br>                    The average age of first sexual encounter for men has come                     down from 23 in 2004 to 18. </p>                  <p> In the 2005 survey of single women, 42 per cent said they                     had their first sexual encounter between the ages of 19 and                     21.</p>                  <p> <strong>Do you expect the woman you marry to be a virgin?</strong></p>                  <p> YES - 63%<br>                    NO - 24%<br>                    Rest: Does not matter/Don't know/Can't say</p>                  <p> In the 2005 survey of single women, 66 per cent agreed,                     saying women should remain virgins till they are married.</p>                  <p> 65% in Delhi have sex once a week or more often</p>                  <p> <strong>How important is sex in your life?</strong></p>                  <p> VERY IMPORTANT - 47%<br>                    IMPORTANT - 33%<br>                    INDIFFERENT - 12%<br>                    NOT IMPORTANT - 4%<br>                    Rest Don't know/Can't say<br>                    In India Today's 2004 survey of 18-55-year-old men, 51 per                     cent thought sex was very important, while 77 per cent had                     had sex-understandable given the wider age span.</p>                  <p> Thirty-four per cent of the single women surveyed in 2005                     said sex was important to them and 26 per cent thought it                     was very important.

   </tr>      </table>      Technology is driving relationships, with people using phones, SMSes         and e-mails to communicate. Cards appear to be history. The telecommunications         and sexual revolutions are mutually sustaining: the SIM card and the Single         Young Male (SYM) are perfect fits. The three major topics for discussion         are movies, studies and fashion. Discussion of sex with female friends         ranks sixth except in Delhi, which tops the trend in sharing lewd jokes         with women. The priority of topics discussed with males does not differ         much from those discussed with females, an indication of media influence.       </p>      <p> If peer groups are for fun, parents are for serious issues. It is as         if there is geography to conversational topics. Money worries and career         woes figure in domestic conversations, while peer groups focus on the         frivolous. The single young man in public may be a glib achiever, but         with his parents, he can be himself-unsure about his career or troubled         about money. But how does the domestic space deal with the inevitable         intrusions? There is an opening here that must be emphasised. Parents         seem to be fairly liberal about relationships but 66 per cent object to         late nights. Ahmedabad reflects a certain parental laxity at 49 per cent.         Except in Chennai, Ahmedabad and Jaipur, men feel women in their home         have almost equal rights. Either as a fact or perception, such an idea         remains interesting.</p>      <p> E<br>        quality, at least in the commercial sense, is extended to men feeling         quite comfortable with women paying or sharing costs. The ambit of consumption         also seems clear. The average budget when going out with friends ranges         from Rs 100-150. There is no radical shift between the North and the South.         Regardless of status, men are ready to spend. The relationship between         boys and girls may not revolutionise sex, but it is going to stimulate         retail therapy. </p>      <p> So what do boys do to attract girls? The rituals of attraction hover         around grooming. One needs a self constructed out of prominent brands         to stand out. Even body-building is more an act of cultural affirmation,         emerging out of the collective wisdom of gyms and VLCC. While conspicuous         consumption and good grooming ease the mating game, one needs to smoke,         drink and throw parties to attract the attention of girls. Behaving roughly         qualifies as an &quot;attractor&quot;, but percentages are down except         in Chennai.</p>      <p> Men generally hang around other men, with Patna and Ludhiana more prone         to stag crowds and Bangalore and Mumbai preferring mixed groups. Ahmedabad         again is the odd one out, with crowds being disproportionately female.         When men are together they haunt spaces like restaurants and malls. When         the sexes are mixed, the park becomes a prominent refuge, second only         to the restaurant. The friend's place is another alternative to take your         girlfriend to. Home is still one solution, with Mumbai and Lucknow seeing         it as a major option.</p>      <p> Enabled by technology, young men are still circumscribed by society.         Fear of being seen with a girlfriend is not a problem for Bangaloreans.         What they object to is being stared at. Fear of manhandling by the moral         police is highest in Delhi (32 per cent) and Hyderabad (26 per cent).       </p>      <p> Now comes the inevitable question. Who do men consider the sexiest woman?         The selection is predictable, but it makes you wonder whether sexiness         is partly a construct of the media. But let's face it. North, South, East,         West, Aishwarya Rai is the sexiest. The only threats come from Delhi and         Ludhiana, where Bipasha Basu has a considerable following. Mallika Sherawat,         a favourite in Lucknow and Patna, is a happy third. Almost disloyally,         the category &quot;my girl friend&quot; polls an average of five, endearing         but marginal. When it comes to the sexiest man, it is John Abraham doing         well except in Hyderabad. The hunks dominate the list, with Hrithik Roshan,         Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar in the top 10. New-age men like Aamir Khan,         Abhishek Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan still hold their place, and Amitabh         Bachchan leads the rear guard at ninth position. </p>      <p> From sexiness to sex. The latter is considered important across the         cities. The all-India average rests at 47 per cent for &quot;very important&quot;         and 33 per cent for &quot;important&quot;. It is a normality that is assuring.         Hyderabad responds with a thumping 66 per cent saying sex is very important,         while in Lucknow, a good 23 per cent profess to be indifferent. </p>      <p> In attitudes and values, we stumble across the great hypocrisy reef         of India. The modern Indian man-as many as 80 per cent in Hyderabad and         Chennai-expects the woman he marries to be a virgin. The duality persists.         When asked about pre-marital sex, men seem willing as long as there is         a sense of commitment. Yet when asked if they would marry a woman who         admits to having pre-marital sex, they produce a resounding no. Mumbai         crosses the dissonance barrier, with 21 per cent saying yes. Most men         add rather cleverly that women often confuse sex with commitment. The         only deviant response is Hyderabad, where 49 per cent don't think so.       </p>      <p> The survey probes further, trying to understand where the sex appeal         of a woman lies. The answers go beyond the predictable notion of beauty         and identify other factors like intelligence and sexual skills. Chennai         and Hyderabad produce a smacker with 12 per cent identifying sex appeal         with submissiveness. Small deviations can be seen in Ahmedabad and Ludhiana,         where 32 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, are ready to date or         marry a much older woman. Pornography is considered good occasionally.         Yet, most men would not tell their girlfriends that they had a one-night         stand. Delhi is the only city that breaks the hypocrite's code.</p>      <p> There is a general equation between revealing clothes and sexual liberation.         Only Lucknow and Ahmedabad challenge this. Then there is a general vote         for equal pleasure for men and women and a large aye for condom use. The         average age of the first sexual encounter is dropping, most men being         initiated between 16 and 20, but with whom is a big question, with the         2005 India Today survey of single young women showing that only 24 per         cent had had sex. Men are possessive about the women they have had sex         with. Most men confess to some homosexual experience-37 per cent have         had at least one such experience-but rarely talk about it. </p>      <p> Most are happy with their sexual experiences but feel upset about sex         when it gets repetitive with the same woman or if the woman shows emotional         expectations. A large percentage feel they can impose their need for sex         regardless of their girlfriend's mood. Men are content with penis size         and insist that a majority of their women have orgasms. A large fraction         seems to have engaged in group sex and 11 per cent seem bisexual, with         Hyderabad revealing a high of 24 per cent. Men prefer long foreplay with         different towns itemising different priorities. A happy unity in diversity,         not really kinky, but may be a bit too content about performance.</p>      <p> At least 49 per cent confess to at least one encounter with sex workers.         As far as experimentation goes, sex in front of a mirror or in cars seems         common. Disconcertingly, 14 per cent claim to have had sex with family         members. </p>      <p> So this is the single young urban Indian male, homogeneous across cities         big and small, content about his performance, openly hypocritical and         often contradictory. Cities, rather than adding to sexual diversity, add         homogeneity. The survey sees sex as consumption and even though 81 per         cent do not have credit cards, 56 per cent go to gyms and 71 per cent         have mobile phones. The sym does not really surprise you, but with technology,         urbanism and consumption providing the real triggers of sexuality, a slow         standardisation is afoot. The young man is still not a man in full, unable         to resolve his sexual identity with the multiple roles ahead: that of         good son, great buddy and a responsible adult. Placidly confused today,         he looks headed for moral dilemmas tomorrow.</p>      <p align="right"><strong>The writer is a cultural anthropologist.</strong></p>      <p><br>        <br>      </p>
