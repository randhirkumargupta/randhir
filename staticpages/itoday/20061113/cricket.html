From what he could see of their body language in recent         games, the laconic Buchanan said, India lacked a bit of spark, a bit of         verve, a bit of &quot;oomph&quot;. </p>      <p> Somehow supplying the men in blue with inflammable objects, disco music         and item numbers didn't seem helpful. Specially for a team collectively         going down in flames, whose attachment to iPods has caused a red mist         to descend on its management. </p>      <p> India was expected to show off its new clothes as one of the fastest         improving teams in world cricket in the Champions Trophy. Familiar conditions         were expected to scrape off early season rust, the roar of home fans to         drown out recollections of bitter ODI defeats in the Caribbean. </p>      <p> But no matter how many 'positives' the spin doctors wring out of it,         India's failure to make the Champions Trophy semi-final is deflating.         Defeat to Australia was the punch that sent them to the floor; but losing         six of their last eight games to the West Indies were unmistakable signs         that the wobbles are upon us. After an exhilarating last season, India         has won only four of its last 15 ODIs and two from eight this season.       </p>      <p> &quot;It is a setback, if you can call it...&quot; captain Rahul Dravid         tailed off. Better call it like it is. The Champions Trophy was the best         possible benchmark for the growth of his team. In utopia, by now Irfan         Pathan's swing would have its sting back, his pinch-hitting giving the         batting acceleration at No. 3, spinners would have been loathe to bowl         to India's new cool middle order finisher, Virender Sehwag, form would         have stayed faithful to Dravid and Yuvraj Singh and the faith invested         in Suresh Raina would have been repaid in runs. </p>      <p> These best-laid plans are now unravelled, or going by some of the decisions         taken by the Indians, unhinged. The captain admitted, &quot;Now we must         review where we're at and take the steps to turn things around.&quot;         The difference between the cerebral and mental has been reduced to the         margin between a win and a loss. </p>      <p> Four months away from the World Cup, it is probably time to go shopping         for specifics, across all departments of Indian cricket: </p>      <p> <strong>A SHOCK ABSORBER FOR THE CAPTAIN</strong></p>      <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" align="right">        <tr>           <td><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td height="30" class="mediumtext">&nbsp;&nbsp;PICTURE SPEAK</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr align="center">           <td height="140"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/cri3.jpg" width="190" height="130"></td>        </tr>        <tr align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">           <td class="tabledata"> <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">              <tr>                 <td class="tabledata"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">CAST                   OF CHARACTERS; </font> Patel and Singh (above); coach Chappell                   (below)</td>              </tr>              <tr>                 <td class="tabledata"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/cri4.jpg" width="190" height="130"></td>              </tr>            </table></td>        </tr>      </table>To put it at its simplest, Rahul needs a Rahul. To his predecessor Sourav         Ganguly, Dravid was the perfect vice-captain. A sounding board, a counsel,         a voice of reason and, when things got hairy as they often did, a frontman         sent to handle a snapping, sniping media. In an environment of prickly         egos, Dravid was often on diplomatic duty, counselling younger players         or soothing the bruised pride of the older players. Along with Anil Kumble,         he was the de facto negotiator for the team when dealing with the Board         on players contracts or commercial issues. Today, as one tough day is         succeeded by a long evening of disappointment, Dravid remains the lone,         forlorn face for the team. His deputy Sehwag is under siege due to his         wavering ODI batting and its fallout: pressure from the selectors and         the management. There is a move to examine whether he serves his role         as vice-captain well enough or if India has jumped the gun on his being         a natural leader. Tendulkar and Kumble's recent absences have meant that         Dravid will feel the lack of other authority figures and mentors for younger         players. </p>      <p> The captain could also do with a long-distance view of his team. Like         an unreliable pipe, it has begun to leak and rumble. Player and selector         are often heard in uncanny parallel echo. The single most commonly-articulated         criticism of the two at the top is not (as widely believed) that the captain         allows himself to be dominated by the coach, but a lack of even-handedness.         Said one selector, &quot;Certain rules and standards seem to apply only         to certain people while others seem exempt.&quot;</p>      <p> <strong>THERAPY SESSIONS FOR THE BATSMEN</strong></p>      <p> Despite the presence of high-pedigree batsmen in and around them in         the dressing room, the Indian batting's run of form over the last six         months probably means that couch should win over coach right now. </p>      <p> A crash course in auto-hypnosis for Sehwag could possibly convince him         that his blue uniform is actually white and all he needs to do in an ODI         is to bat until the game breaks for a meal. For the rest, a round robin         approach is perhaps best: regular chanting of the phrase &quot;I will         take singles&quot;, meditation for Tendulkar to tap into his inner Zen         And for Dravid, a few days out with his local chapter of the Laughter         Club. </p>      <p> India's batting form is like returns on investment: there is no such         thing as too much. Buchanan says what made the Indians competitive against         the Aussies was always their reliability with the bat. &quot;That certainty         that there are big runs allows the rest of the guys to relax-the bowlers         don't have to try to do something every ball, the field is not tense...&quot;</p>      <p> Dravid remembered &quot;people stood up...if we can go back to doing         that a lot of questions will answer themselves.&quot; The key that will         set in motion the chain reaction of batsmen 'standing up' in succession         is today jammed in the lock. Dravid's batting 'unit' is a diffused entity,         not a fortress. Individual worries override the idea of the collective.         After a recent series, one batsman grumbled about not getting as much         attention to his problems as a close rival did. Another is so unsure of         where he stands that whenever he is called over for a word with Dravid         or Chappell, he thinks he is going to be dropped.</p>      <p> <strong>GEOMETRY BOXES FOR THE BOWLERS</strong></p>      <p> To sort out lines and lengths, width and angles and to take a close         look at what a working compass really looks like. India's motley crew         of young quick bowlers cannot hide behind the fig leaves of inexperience         because the Champions Trophy has been full of raw bowlers who have made         their mark-like Australia's Mitchell Johnson or the West Indies' underrated         Ian Bradshaw. Whatever collective planning is being formulated is undone         by a sibling rivalry amongst the young quicks that is far from healthy.         The low level sniping that accompanies it is a product of the revolving         door selections in recent months in which the price of defeat is paid         most consistently by young fast bowlers, not underperforming batters.         Maybe the geometry box could do with some quick-bonding super glue as         well. </p>      <p> <strong>A MIRROR FOR THE COACH</strong></p>      <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" align="right">        <tr>           <td><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">           <td class="tabledata"> <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">              <tr align="center">                 <td class="tabledata"><span class="mediumtext">&quot;India's body                   language seemed to lack a bit of verve, spark...&quot;<br>                  </span><span class="verdana1"><font color="#FF0000">JOHN BUCHANAN,</font><br>                  AUSTRALIAN COACH</span></td>              </tr>            </table></td>        </tr>      </table>      Greg Chappell was given the job of team coach and security of tenure         with it. It was an assignment connected but still dissimilar to the many         other roles played by the 58-year-old: cricket legend, batting guru, radical         thinker. After a year with India, the coach could use a mirror for a bout         of introspection. He may not be able to bat for the batsmen or bowl for         the bowlers, but Chappell could put a few questions to himself about where         he and his team stand. As coach, is the team he works with united and         stable? Are the players under his charge relaxed and confident? Does he         take the pressure off Dravid when it comes to the messy dynamics of man         management and the daily stress test of the media? Does he have the humility         to admit his Way might not be The Best Way or the Only Way? Is sending         out messages about players via the press the smartest way to set an agenda         for the team? Has he won their trust and loyalty? Are they winning? The         mirror's job is easy. </p>      <p> No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.</p>      <p> <strong>SCALES OF JUSTICE FOR SELECTORS</strong></p>      <p> In a startling interview given to a cricket magazine recently, outgoing         national selector V.B. Chandrasekhar said, &quot;I would not find fault         with people for saying that this (the previous) selection committee was         being run by the team management.&quot; The arrival of Dilip Vengsarkar         at the helm of the selection committee has immediately signalled a change         in that equation. Vengsarkar is said to have been vocal and forthright         in his first meeting. It was marked by the return of Zaheer Khan and the         surprising selection of Wasim Jaffer as ODI opener on the tour to South         Africa. Vengsarkar's first meeting was perhaps more a setting of boundaries         than an upsetting of the applecart. One selector admitted, &quot;I don't         know how many changes can be made from now to the World Cup.&quot; The         high turnover of players over the past year has not led to decisions about         the suitability of even a few players for top-bracket cricket. It has         only led to conclusions about those considered unsuitable. Dravid and         Chappell may loathe going back to the old, but what Vengsarkar needs to         be able to do is steer his committee into judgements on form and skill         delivery rather than differences of personality. Just like players and         captains are tested under pressure, so are selectors. The best ones respond         by thinking clearly, objectively and independently. </p>      <p> <strong>DUCT TAPE FOR THE BCCI</strong></p>      <p> (An entire roll only for Lalit Modi) To tape up mouths so that there         is no more irrelevant talking.

We don't want to hear about ICC's neo-colonialism.         We don't want to hear about TV rights.
