Sexual satisfaction                     is not the only thing that has come down in this year's survey.                     The number of men who have sex every day has dropped from                     20 per cent to 10.</p>                  <p> In the 2005 survey, women fared better: 47 per cent were                     very happy with their sex lives, 28 per cent were reasonably                     happy and 19 per cent were just about satisfied.</p>                                  </td>              </tr>            </table></td>        </tr>      </table>      There was a time in the 1970s when the catch phrase &quot;youth of India&quot;       signified a moral force which, properly harnessed, could be used-rather       like big dams-for the sake of the nation. While not explicitly stated, it       was clear that this youthful moral force was all-male. The youth themselves       were neither expected nor encouraged to give direction to the country. That       was still the work of the khadi-clad &quot;grown-ups&quot;.</p>       <p> Today, Indians under 25 are expected to rip through economic and social         barriers on a cultural bull run and shape India's future-immediately,         dramatically and on a global scale. The matadors of modernity are a band         of well-groomed young men who can party while striking tech-savvy deals.         Young women are included, but only those who buy washing machines and         microwaves on Diwali and raise their children on sunflower oil, emerging         as a new breed of family-friendly consumers. The new youth of India lay         claim to a novel imaginary vision-the great Indian shoppers' stop where         even babies are consumers, expressing deep contentment with branded nappies         and sleeping like munna rajas when silent air-conditioners are switched         on. The youth of such a glorious desh are an enchanted lot, flashing their         credit cards, hanging out in malls and markets and wooing their sweethearts         with expensive gifts.</p>      <p> As always, reality is a bit grimmer. Eighty-one per cent young men in         metros and small towns don't personally own credit cards. If any cards         are flaunted, they're probably add-ons with parents keeping a watch on         credit limits. Boys chill out in malls but rarely spend more than a couple         of hundred rupees when they're hanging out with friends, though they'll         spend double that amount when they go out with their girlfriends.</p>      <p> Far from being big-spending decision makers, young men are still in         the thrall of parental diktat. Parents disapprove of late nights, impose         prohibitions on who can and cannot come home for a visit, provide mobile         phones, but discourage calls from girls. Almost 70 per cent of young men         under the age of 22 rarely, if ever, receive calls from or make calls         to female friends. Sixteen to 18-year-olds in smaller cities like Patna         and Ludhiana are most constrained, though a high percentage of parents         in the globalising metros of Bangalore and Hyderabad object to their sons         mixing with girls. You'd think that lounge bars and fast food outlets         of urban landscapes are symbols of transformed gender relations. However,         even in bigger metros, mixed-gender groups are only half as likely as         single gendered ones.</p>      <p> Most young men meet girls in college, though the boys in Chennai are         as likely to have met girls who live in the same neighbourhood or girls         who've been introduced by family members. Chennai neighbourhoods may be         more homogeneous in terms of caste affiliations and the girl-next-door         is considered an appropriate friend. It's clear that families in India         don't liberate children easily. A 25-year-old may be an earning professional         but he preserves parental values. He'd want to marry a woman who is a         virgin, and while he may exchange a dirty joke or two with female friends,         sex is hardly discussed. </p>      <p> Cherishing common values does not translate into mutual candour between         parents and sons. Small-town mums are fairly sensitive about the personal         problems of their betas, but overall, mothers seem more concerned about         money and career issues. Fathers focus on careers and money matters as         well, with the exception of those in Chennai and Lucknow who do seem to         think about their sons' personal problems. Even for such fathers, &quot;personal         problems&quot; don't include affairs gone awry.</p>      <p> A muddled young man turns to his all-male group of friends with whom         he stays in constant touch, phoning and messaging to discuss dilemmas,         fashion and movies. The group is clearly fostered on a spirit of egalitarian         give-and-take. Pornography is exchanged within the group like cigarettes         and coffee, bringing boys together in a shared circle of friendship. Almost         50 per cent discuss sex and relationships with their male friends. </p>      <p> The big question for young men is: where are the girls? In the 1980s         and the early 1990s, before Indians systematically plugged into global         lifestyles and everything from consumer spending to sexual attitudes allegedly         changed, a girlfriend was an incredible but improbable miracle. Now, friends         smoothen the progress of love, acting as helpful intermediaries. </p>      <p> The general lack of girls in a lad's life probably stems from gender         segregation that is evident in smaller towns, but also present in some         form in emerging metros. Segregation creates its own power regimes. Boys         below 18 demonstrate their manhood by passing lewd comments on girls.         Men in Hyderabad and Bangalore are as likely to harass a woman as those         in Ludhiana and Delhi. The conversion of public space into danger zones         isn't just a problem for women. For young men, being with a girl in public         spaces becomes a trial, an ordeal created for men by men. This hostility         towards love that makes gender-mixing a hassle is the fountainhead of         the clash between the young Indian male's familial proclivities and his         camouflaged love life.</p>      <p align="right"><strong>The writer is a sociologist.</strong><br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="210" border="0" cellspacing="1" align="center" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="410" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="410" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"> <table width="405" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" align="center" bgcolor="e5e5e5">              <tr>                 <td class="small-text1" bgcolor="f0f0f0"> <p><span class="headline">Where                     Cash Meets Conservatism</span><span class="tabledata"><font color="#000000">                     THE CITY OF LUDHIANA IS ALL ABOUT DUALISM</font></span></p>                  <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" align="right">                    <tr>                       <td><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                       <td height="30" class="mediumtext">&nbsp;&nbsp;PICTURE SPEAK</td>                    </tr>                    <tr>                       <td><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200." height="2"></td>                    </tr>                    <tr align="center">                       <td height="140"><img src="/itoday/20061113/grfx/cov4.jpg" width="190" height="130"></td>                    </tr>                    <tr align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">                       <td class="tabledata"> <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">                          <tr>                             <td class="tabledata"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">FANTASY                               LAND</font><br>                              Youngsters at a Ludhiana disco</td>                          </tr>                        </table></td>                    </tr>                  </table>                  <span class="tabledata"><font color="#000000">Since Partition,                     when hungry-for-success refugees redefined its working culture,                     Ludhiana has been an all-time incubator of rags-to-riches                     stories and a trendsetter in ceaseless consumerism. Fancy                     cars and fairy tale marriages are its defining leitmotif.                     But, behind the flashy veneer lies its alternative reality-that                     of a consummate fantasy land, as is evident in the India Today-AC                     Nielsen-ORG-MARG annual survey of sexuality. Its flirtation                     with money-powered modernity notwithstanding, its young singletons                     are firmly wedded to traditional values-a subterranean streak                     confirmed by 81 per cent young men saying they won't marry                     a woman who is not a virgin. Despite its brush with metropolitan                     status, Ludhiana is still a 'little big place' with a closely-knit                     society. &quot;The city doesn't afford any anonymity for its                     young crowd to experiment with liberal ideas like dating,&quot;                     says Neha Kapoor, a 20-year-old college student.</font></span></p>                  <p><font color="#000000"> A rich fantasy life-48 per cent have                     had sex in front of a mirror and 32 per cent have had sex                     in a car-stems from the scarcity of public space and opportunities                     for the young generation to hang out. It also explains the                     dominance of pornography: 78 per cent, the highest across                     cities, share pornographic films with friends. The city has                     no discotheque, just four pubs and only one air-conditioned                     movie theatre.</font></p>                  <p><font color="#000000"> The absence of a co-educational college                     and a small population of working women are other barriers                     to inter-sex interaction. Little wonder then that Ludhiana                     has the highest percentage of all-male buddies (70 per cent).                     A majority of marriages are still arranged-especially as the                     youth in business families are financially dependent on their                     parents. Boys and girls now interact more freely, but the                     degree of intimacy is still bound by patriarchal values. Two-thirds                     of the respondents report that their parents object to late                     nights and an equal number say that women don't come home                     to visit them.</font></p>                  <p><font color="#000000"> Ludhiana has, in the past decade-and-a-half,                     seen a new crop of successful entrepreneurs. The overnight                     affluence and the resulting occasional deviations from well-entrenched                     taboos are triggering brash and criminal behaviour. In June                     this year, a Britain-educated son of a leading business family                     was killed allegedly for his relationship with a girl from                     abroad and his gunshot-riddled body was recovered from Himachal                     Pradesh.</font></p>                  <p><font color="#000000"> While Ludhiana's social ethos dictates                     suppressed sexuality, its fast-growing glitterati is manifesting                     its fantasies in exhibitionist consumerism. Over 80 per cent,                     again the highest across cities, say they are well-groomed                     to attract women. From importing orchids to hiring Bollywood                     stars, Ludhiana's weddings are the ultimate indulgence. Of                     the 600-odd djs in the city, at least a dozen command more                     than Rs 1 lakh per performance.The cash for consumable culture                     extends to even sex: 63 per cent, the highest across the nation,                     have been with a sex worker.</font></p>                  <p><span class="tabledata"><br>                    </span></p>
