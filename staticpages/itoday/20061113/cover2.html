I         would wager that some answers would tap into your fantasy, some will reflect         interesting facts about the social milieu within which you take your pleasures         and still others will be the artifacts of the very questions that have         been asked. Sexual behaviour is notoriously difficult to research as most         public health researchers writing on old and new sexually transmitted         diseases are discovering. Yet there is a fascination with the lives of         the young and a great emotional investment in them on the part of policy         makers, religious leaders and, of course, parents. </p> </p>      <p> But let us not jump to the question of morals too quickly on the basis         of the survey on male sexuality. Let us instead treat the results of the         India Today survey as a lens with which to see conflicting desires, self-creation         and the mediated environment in which urban youth in India live today.         The world that the young inhabit is not that of their parents. The futures         they are creating are paths they must learn to walk without the shadows         of their elders constantly looming behind them. The young too will learn         in time that sexuality is not only about stolen pleasures but also about         self-formation, about intimacy and carrying the risks of intimacy-for         human beings can pose great dangers to each other and never more than         when they are sexually intimate and &quot;in love&quot;. </p>      <p> By definition, surveys can provide a surface understanding of a phenomena         and they can tell us about the dimensions of a problem. It is obvious         from this survey that the environment of a city has a strong influence         on sexual attitudes. The city provides conditions under which young men         can meet young women in ordinary settings such as colleges, and explore         the possibilities of forming relationships. There is strong evidence of         the changes in the communication environment of the young. Though there         are some differences between the larger, more cosmopolitan cities in the         use of the Internet, a very large number (two out of three) use mobile         phones to keep in touch. Movies and television provide not only images         but also topics of conversation. Much of the language of love is usually         taken from cinema. </p>      <p> The differences between social classes on the topics of sexual pleasures         are marginal-the media has created publics in which all social classes         participate. This impression is confirmed by reality shows on television.         The Indian Idol could be a young man hailing from a small town who speaks         no English, but in the course of the competition his body language is         slowly transformed to suggest that he is a &quot;sexy&quot; person with         an appeal for a widely dispersed audience. The role of such public spectacles         in creating a picture of a non-threatening sexuality-the boy swinging         his hips and singing an alluring song surrounded by kin-is important.         The camera often focuses on the face of an anxious mother and the contestants         touching the feet of the &quot;guru&quot;, or the judge, suitably inscribing         the idea of &quot;tradition&quot; within song and dance. </p>      <p> I would be cautious in interpreting the results of questions about the         frequency of sexual experience, or the positions adopted or questions         about experimental sex. Sometimes when you give choices in a questionnaire         such as the ones given here (for example, asking if you ever have sex         before a mirror) you might tap into a fantasy or even provide a picture         of what sex could be rather than what it is in someone's life. Yet, I         am quite impressed that even as a thought experiment about whether a woman         who is not a virgin would be acceptable as a wife, about one-fourth of         the young men reported they would have no objections. This suggests that         the distinction between the good woman (one who is good to marry) and         the bad woman (one who is good to have sex with) might be loosening. And         this is encouraging. </p>      <p> There are some issues that come up in this survey which alarm me. For         example, the sexual liberation movement, or as some would say, the sexual         revolution of the 1960s, became severely strained by the realisation by         feminists that sexual liberation was less about a radical alternative         to rigid norms of sexuality and more about making women's bodies much         more available without any attendant responsibilities on men. The second         event was the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It alarms me that those         who design surveys do not think beyond cursory questions about the dangers         of unprotected sex. Any probing questions, except one on same-sex experiences,         are usually ignored. The media might have contributed to the creation         of an environment in which these issues are allowed to be eclipsed while         sexuality is made to appear as completely devoid of any threat. However,         the increased awareness about condom use-over 50 per cent men think it         is a must-is reassuring. </p>      <p> For the past several years I have been researching the nature of social         networks in urban neighbourhoods in Delhi. It has given me an opportunity         to see how images of male sexuality created in this highly mediated environment         circulate within locally embedded publics. In low-income areas in the         city, groups of young men who have dropped out of school because they         could not cope with English and Maths roam around in small groups, repeatedly         discussing ways of becoming rich. Parents of adolescent girls consider         these young men to be a great danger to their daughters and so restrict         the movement of girls in all sorts of ways.</p>      <p> Still, many alliances develop in the neighbourhoods. There have been         cases where a girl has eloped with a boy only to be &quot;returned&quot;         after a couple of years. Cases of rape against young men are sometimes         filed in courts by the parents in connivance with the police simply to         punish a boy for having had an affair with their daughter. Sometimes love         flourishes across the boundaries of religion and caste. Such young people         seek the protection of courts to register civil marriages but are often         chased by relatives and political functionaries of the RSS on the one         hand and Jamaat activists on the other, and by the police to &quot;recover'         the girl on behalf of her parents. Yet I have also seen extraordinary         ways young people devise to try to be together and in some cases parents         try to acknowledge the genuine desire of a young boy or girl to live with         the one he or she loves. As one Hindu woman explaining to me why she was         happy to have her son and his Muslim bride live with her in a joint family,         said, &quot;There are many people who will carry forward the Hindu tradition,         but my child is my child-how can I take away his happiness?&quot; I will         let her words carry the weight of my belief that in such small acts of         love we might learn to endorse the simple idea that sexual life is to         be cherished as evidence of our ability to care for the other.</p>      <p> The writer is an anthropologist.</p>      <p><br>
