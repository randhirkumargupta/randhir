                              <p>They never tell the full story. Memoirs of our out-of-power bureaucrats         are mostly bland affairs, cottage industry vanity publications that are         never an enlightening read but, invariably, an insult to the reader's         intelligence. So another clumsy attempt at immortality-that is what crossed         my mind when I turned the first page of P.C. Alexander's memoirs. I didn't         expect to see a slice of untold history in those pages. As I went along,         the reviewer's-more aptly the political reporter's-scepticism intact,         I realised that I was turning the pages rather fast, that I was getting         privileged access to the corridors of power, especially to their twilight         zones, that I was beginning to see some familiar figures who dominated         the politics of the last few decades in a different angle. Most significantly,         I was introduced to a new Alexander. </p>

                              <p>Interestingly different from the Alexander we know-currently member of         the Rajya Sabha and formerly principal secretary to Indira Gandhi and         Rajiv Gandhi, high commissioner, governor, the President India never had.         That Alexander, the pre-memoirs Alexander, had such an illustrious innings         as a loyalist in the Gandhi durbar and as a civil servant who never retired         and was always wanted. Alexander between covers, as he evolves from paragraph         to paragraph, is more powerful, more &quot;principal&quot; than your average         principal secretary. He justifies the subtitle: he is truly an insider         and never a passive one. There he is, an IAS officer originally from the         Kerala cadre, making it big in Delhi, with the customary lows and downs.         Morarji Desai was nasty: he threw Alexander out of the commerce ministry         and the man from Mavelikkara, survivor par excellence, had another safe-and         lucrative-landing at the UN. Indira Gandhi would bring him back to Delhi.</p>
                              <p>The rise of Alexander coincided with Mrs G's return to power in 1980         after the Janata fiasco. As principal secretary in Indira Gandhi's PMO,         he would became India's most powerful bureaucrat. &quot;She expected me         not to be just a bureaucrat running the PMO and helping her in her administrative         responsibilities as prime minister; very soon I found that I had to take         on several duties and responsibilities far beyond the normal field of         work allotted to a civil servant.&quot; It was Mrs Gandhi who made the         PMO the ultimate powerhouse. For Nehru, there was no principal secretary,         there was only a principal private secretary who headed the prime minister's         secretariat. As Alexander himself says, &quot;Nehru briefed the bureaucrats         instead of being briefed by them.&quot; That would not be the story in         post-Nehru India. An all-powerful principal secretary meant a politically         weakened prime minister. L.K. Jha (Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira); P.N.         Haksar (Indira); P.N. Dhar (Indira); V. Shankar (Morarji); A.N. Verma         (P.V. Narasimha Rao); Brijesh Mishra (A.B. Vajpayee)-their influence on         their bosses was immense, as Alexander's was on Mrs G and, after her assassination,         on Rajiv. His secretarial duties ranged from appointment of Congress chief         ministers and selection of Union ministers to forging alliances to the         smooth coronation of Rajiv. </p>
                              <p> The principal secretary emerges out of this memoirs as a formidable         force behind the master. Rather, on many occasions, he is the principal         arbiter. It is an important book, not for the &quot;different&quot; picture         it portrays of the events that changed the course of our history alone         but for what it says about the role of the bureaucrat in India. The bureaucrat         runs the government. More correctly perhaps, he runs the politician. Finally,         denying him the ultimate glory of the presidency, the politician let Alexander         down. It was the cruellest irony of his life. His address as a Rajya Sabha         member gives a new twist to the irony. 12 Willingdon Crescent, New Delhi,         was Indira Gandhi's address when she was out of power. Alexander regains         power by writing about it. </p>

                                                <p><span class="tabledata"> It was my firm conviction as soon                     as I received the news of the tragedy (Indira Gandhi's assassination)                     that the most feasible arrangement would be to have Rajiv                     sworn in immediately as prime minister without going in for                     an interim prime minister. I held hurried consultations with                     Shivshankar and B. Shankaranand, senior ministers in Indira                     Gandhi's cabinet, who had rushed to AIIMS. They both expressed                     their strongly held view that Pranab Mukherjee should not                     be sworn in as interim prime minister, although he was high                     up in the hierarchy. Indira Gandhi had not formally nominated                     anyone as second in command in her cabinet though, informally,                     Mukherjee occupied such a position. By then chief ministers                     from the Congress-ruled states had arrived at the institute                     and were standing together on the eighth floor in one section                     of the verandah. I knew that a final decision on the succession                     issue could be taken only by Rajiv who was already on his                     way to Delhi from Calcutta. However, I thought it would be                     prudent to quickly ascertain the views of the chief ministers,                     the ministers and other senior members of the party present                     there on the question of succession. I sought the opinions                     of N.D. Tewari (chief minister of Uttar Pradesh), Janaki Ballabh                     Patnaik (chief minister of Orissa), Bhajan Lal (chief minister                     of Haryana) and Shiv Charan Mathur (chief minister of Rajasthan)                     ... I found that everyone was in agreement with the suggestion                     that Rajiv should be administered the oath forthwith. (I was                     convinced that an interim arrangement with Pranab Mukherjee                     as prime minister, even for a brief period, would not be acceptable                     to any senior Congress leader present at the institute). Within                     a few minutes Narasimha Rao reached the eighth floor. We embraced                     each other, without being able to control our tears. I told                     him quickly that there was unanimity among all the chief ministers                     and the ministers present at the institute that Rajiv should                     be sworn in directly as PM and he fully endorsed the proposal.</span></p>

                                                <p><span class="tabledata">Rajiv arrived at 3.15 p.m. along                     with Pranab Mukherjee and Arun Nehru (one of Rajiv's cousins).                     After greeting us with folded hands, Rajiv quickly went inside                     the room adjacent to the operation theatre, where his wife                     Sonia Gandhi had been standing near the wall and sobbing.                     His face was filled with anguish, but he was trying to be                     calm and composed without being overly emotional.</span></p>
                                                <p><span class="tabledata"> I quickly told Pranab Mukherjee                     that everyone had agreed that Rajiv should be administered                     the oath of office as PM without going in for an interim arrangement.                     Without any hesitation, Pranab Mukherjee gave his assent to                     this suggestion. A group of individuals, with malicious intent,                     later spread a canard that Pranab Mukherjee had staked his                     claim to be sworn in as interim PM and had to be persuaded                     with great difficulty to withdraw his claim. The obvious objective                     was to create discord between Rajiv Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee.                     But I should record here the true fact that Pranab Mukherjee                     had readily endorsed the suggestion I made to him ...</span></p>
                                                <p><span class="tabledata"> Arun Nehru took me aside and told                     me in a very serious tone that Rajiv should be sworn in immediately                     by the vice-president without waiting for the president's                     arrival ... They were of the view that President Zail Singh                     could not be trusted to accept Rajiv's nomination without                     a formal election by the Congress Parliamentary Party. They                     were genuinely apprehensive that because of the recent deterioration                     in the relations between Zail Singh and Indira Gandhi, he                     might use his position to prevent Rajiv from becoming prime                     minister and may administer the oath to Pranab Mukherjee as                     interim prime minister Such a development could lead to serious                     difficulties as far as Rajiv's election later was concerned                     ... </span></p>
                                                <p><span class="tabledata"> However, I was quite convinced that                     it would be ethically very wrong and politically very unwise                     if the president were made to feel that he had been deliberately                     denied the exercise of his most important responsibility,                     namely, choosing the prime minister and administering the                     oath of office to him. I was seriously worried that if Rajiv                     were administered the oath by the vice-president, Zail Singh                     would view this step as a challenge to his authority and may                     even take the extreme step of not recognizing the oath administered                     by the vice-president...</span></p>
                                                <p><span class="tabledata"> I was also quite conscious of the                     fact that I had no official standing or authority to enforce                     my own views on the late prime minister's senior colleagues                     in her party. Whenever I had done so in the past, I did so                     with the confidence that I had the backing of the prime minister,                     but, theoretically, I had ceased to be principal secretary                     the minute Indira Gandhi was no more ... No one at that time                     questioned my authority to press on with this line of action                     because the individuals present there always had great regard                     for me and trusted my sincerity ... However, Arun Nehru, supported                     by a few like-minded individuals, was quite firm in his stand                     that no risk could be taken in this matter. He asked me, in                     a very defiant tone, as to who would accept the responsibility                     for the consequences if Zail Singh refused to administer the                     oath to Rajiv. My immediate response was that the person who                     was the most concerned about, and who would be most affected                     by this decision was Rajiv and, first of all, his own wishes                     in the matter ought to be ascertained. Arun Nehru declared                     that he would go into the room where Rajiv was standing with                     Sonia and talk to him, but I pre-empted him and I quickly                     went inside the room.</span></p>
                                                <p><span class="tabledata"> What I saw on entering the room                     was Rajiv clasping Sonia with both hands and earnestly conveying                     to her the message that he considered it his duty to take                     on the responsibility as prime minister. Sonia was holding                     him tightly and tears were rolling down her cheeks. She was                     pleading with him not to yield to the forceful request of                     his party colleagues to accept the top post ... I went near                     the couple and gently touched Rajiv on the back of his shoulder                     to indicate that I had some very urgent work with him ...                     </span></p>
                                                <p><span class="tabledata"> I briefly informed him that the                     proposal of Arun Nehru and most of his senior partymen present                     there was to have him sworn in as prime minister by the vice-president                     without waiting for the arrival of the president, as they                     were concerned that Zail Singh might not agree to administer                     the oath to him without being first elected as leader by the                     CPP. Moreover, he may insist on appointing Pranab Mukherjee                     as interim prime minister, which could cause complications                     later. I then explained all the reasons why I personally felt                     that the correct and even prudent course would be to wait                     till the president arrived and asked him (Rajiv) for his own                     wishes on this matter. Rajiv listened to me patiently and,                     much to my relief, told me that he fully agreed with my views                     and that the risk, if any, was worth taking. He said he would                     talk to Arun Nehru later, but that I, for my part, should                     go ahead with making the necessary arrangements for the swearing                     in by the president, presuming that he would agree with the                     proposal. I ... conveyed Rajiv's decision to everyone present                     on the eighth floor. Nobody raised any objection after that.</span></p>
