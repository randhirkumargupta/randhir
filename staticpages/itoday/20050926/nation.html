Rightly or wrongly, fairly or unfairly. His family's       14 year rule in Bihar only perpetuated this perception.       <p> Mismanaged, inefficient, loss-laden and customer unfriendly-traits normally         attributed to the Indian Railways, the largest company in India in size,         scale and assets. </p>      <p> No wonder then that when Lalu was made the railways minister in May         2004, the fear was that the &quot;Biharification&quot; of Indian Railways         was imminent. Lalu's initial obsession with the use of khadi and kulhars         in the railways only heightened those fears. </p>      <p>But 16 months after Lalu stepped into Rail Bhavan in Delhi, his report         card looks delightfully different. On most parameters of performance,         the railways are in the midst of an unimaginable turnaround with Lalu         driving the organisation into a relatively transparent, customer-focused,         efficient and above all a cash-rich entity (see charts). The turnaround         in the railways is not only cyclical (driven by a booming economy and         trade), but also structural (driven by fundamental improvements in the         railways' functioning). </p>      <p> Though these are early days, Lalu seems to be doing to the railways         what P.V. Narasimha Rao did to the Indian economy in the 1990s. Driven         by a combination of compulsion, competition and conviction (the last one         most surprising), Lalu is pulling the railways back from the brink, just         as Rao pulled the economy out of a debt trap.</p>      <p> Recognition for Lalu's achievement came from no less than the prime         minister, who recently wrote an effusive four-paragraph letter to the         railways minister congratulating him and his officers for the &quot;hard         work and commendable success&quot; and hoped that the Indian Railways         continued to improve under Lalu's &quot;able guidance&quot;. Validation         has also come from former Railway Board officials, experts and, most importantly,         from big clients of the railways in the cement and steel industries. So         what is Lalu up to and how has he changed the railways?</p>      <p> The first hint that the railways under Lalu may be turning around was         visible in the financial results for 2004-5. The railways' earnings for         the year was Rs 1,883 crore over the target, whereas working expenses         had overshot the estimates by only Rs 400 crore. The result was a boost         in profitability, driven by improved efficiency. The Indian Railways made         the highest allocation in decades to its depreciation and development         funds-indicating that it is investing in its future, rather than feeding         on it. This when just four years ago in July 2001, an expert group headed         by Rakesh Mohan had found the Indian Railways to be &quot;on the verge         of a financial crisis ... and operationally in a terminal debt trap.&quot;       </p>      <table width="210" border="0" cellspacing="1" align="center" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="410" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr bgcolor="#E5E5E5">           <td colspan="3" class="mediumtext" height="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passenger             Privileges</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="410" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3">             <table width="405" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" align="center" bgcolor="e5e5e5">              <tr>                 <td class="small-text1" bgcolor="f0f0f0">                   <p class="headline">e-tickets, open tickets, automatic upgrades                     and an enquiry that works</p>                  <p><span class="small-text1">139 HELPLINE</span></p>                  <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" align="right">                    <tr align="center">                       <td height="140"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/RAILWA3.jpg" width="190" height="130"></td>                    </tr>                  </table>                  <p class="smalltext"><span class="tabledata">ALL LINES ON THIS                     ROUTE AREN'T BUSY: Railway journeys can be frustrating or                     pleasant. But a railways telephone enquiry is seldom pleasant-                     frustration is almost guaranteed. Only a lucky few can get                     through to the enquiry numbers. After few mandatory minutes                     of &quot;Please wait, you are in queue&quot; fewer still get                     through to a human voice. What's more, the information given                     is often incomplete or incorrect. Come March 2006 and all                     this could be history, or so promise Lalu's officials at Rail                     Bhavan. In a revolutionary step, the railways plan to set                     up call centres with 250 phone lines or more in each state                     or railway zone. The universal number of enquiry will be 139                     accessible from all over the state-including villages. Calls                     to the number will be billed as local calls, no matter where                     the caller is located. Two such call centres are already working                     in Patna and Bangalore covering Bihar and Karnataka. Call-centre                     operations will be outsourced. Since India is the hub of global                     call centres, the biggest and the best in business are keen                     to take up the railways project. One of the conditions put                     to prospective operators is that no caller to railway enquiry                     should be put on hold. The railways has specified that phone                     lines dedicated to call centres must be automatically increased                     before the existing lines get engaged. Eventually call centres                     won't be used just for enquiry-passenger will be able to book                     hotels and taxis to avoid the anxieties of commuting and boarding                     on reaching a station. For the railways, these value-added                     services could earn spare cash.<span class="tabledata"> <br>                    </span></span></p>                  <p class="smalltext">AUTOMATIC UPGRADE</p>                  <p class="smalltext"><span class="tabledata">BUY SLEEPER, TRAVEL                     AC: Some four lakh Indians travel in reserved sleeper class                     every day. With luck-and without any extra payment-some of                     them may soon be able to travel in AC compartments. By October                     this year, railways hope to put in place a system of automatic                     upgradation of wait-listed tickets, if there is a vacancy                     in a higher class. So sleeper class wait-listed tickets will                     be confirmed in AC-III, while AC-III wait-listed ticket will                     be confirmed in AC-II and so on if there is a vacancy in higher                     classes at the time of the close of bookings. The software                     designed for upgradation will pick up waitlisted tickets randomly                     for confirmation in the next higher class. For passengers,                     of course, it is a bonus. They won't have to pay extra to                     travel in higher class. For the railways, it is as much an                     exercise in earning goodwill as in earning money. How? Every                     day, the railways returns Rs 8-10 crore for cancelled tickets.                     That's over Rs 3,500 crore of revenues foregone every year.                     The upgradation could help retain about Rs 500 crore. "We                     hope to earn Rs 500 crore in revenue and Rs 50,000 crore in                     goodwill," says Sudhir Kumar, OSD to Lalu Prasad Yadav. On                     an average, 53 per cent of AC-I, 38 per cent of AC-II and                     22 per cent of AC-III seats go vacant, whereas the sleeper                     class' average occupancy is 112 per cent. So next time you                     are waitlisted on a rail journey, you may be in for a pleasant                     surprise.</span></p>                  <p class="smalltext">E-TICKET</p>                  <p class="tabledata">TICKETLESS TRAVEL: Since mid-August those                     booking ticket through www.irctc.co.in are asked: would you                     like an i-ticket or an e-ticket? An i-ticket is a normal ticket                     booked through the Net and delivered by courier. An e-ticket                     is actually ticketless travel-as a convenience, not as a fraud.                     The booking on the Net generates an electronic reservation                     slip (ERS) which can be printed. The print out and a photo                     id is all that is needed for the journey. Right now the facility                     is available only on Delhi-Kalka, Delhi-Amritsar and Delhi-Dehradun                     Shatabdis. And e-tickets can be paid for only with a debit                     card. Within a month the facility will be extended to all                     Shatabdis and Rajdhanis starting from Delhi, and subsequently                     to other cities as well.</p>                  <p><b class="smalltext">QUOTA RAJ</b></p>                  <p class="tabledata"><span class="tabledata"><b>RESERVATIONS</b>:                     When it comes to quotas, the railways could have taught the                     Mandal Commission a lesson or two. There are quotas for defence                     personnel, women, foreign tourists, post and telegraph, railways                     headquarters ... the list goes on. Only about 55 per cent                     of the tickets are available for open booking. Though quotas                     don't necessarily mean loss of revenues, they complicate ticketing                     and breed corruption. Unfilled quota tickets are often sold                     in black.</span></p>                  <p><span class="tabledata"> Under Lalu, two new innovations                     are being experimented with. A review of old quotas has freed                     48,000 seats in the past one year and the railways have decided                     to display vacancies along with reservation charts. That will                     give wait-listed passengers an idea of a vacancy to which                     they have a claim. If they still can't find a seat, their                     ticket can be used another day. The railways will soon allow                     change in date, class or destination of wait-listed tickets.

On almost all parameters, the railways' performance in 2005-6         is set to surpass the target for the year by a higher margin than it did         in 2004-5.</p>      <p> Sure, the Indian Railways' turnaround is fuelled by a booming economy         and exceptionally good growth in key industries like steel and cement         which account for the bulk of railways freight traffic. Besides, initiatives         started during Nitish Kumar's term as the railways minister have also         borne fruits. But while these external factors have given the big push         to the railways, the credit goes to the ministry for being able to take         full advantage of the good times by opting for pathbreaking steps.</p>      <p> The Indian Railways' financial revival began in 2002-3 but its physical         performance took big strides only in the past 16 months. On the freight         side of the business-which accounts for 65 per cent of the railways' income         and almost all of its profits-the big achievement is the reduction in         the turnaround time of wagons from seven days in 2002-3 to 5.5 days, an         improvement of 27 per cent. This amounts to adding a one-fourth freight         carrying capacity without spending on a single new wagon. Besides, since         March this year, railway wagons are carrying 8-16 per cent extra load,         adding that much more to the freight capacity. Again, this was achieved         at marginal additional cost. As a result of these and some other measures,         profit margins in freight have doubled since 2001-2 from 13 paise to 26         paise per net tonne kilometre of freight carried. </p>      <table width="210" border="0" cellspacing="1" align="center" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="410" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr bgcolor="#E5E5E5">           <td colspan="3" class="mediumtext" height="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CATERING             AND PARCEL BUSINESS</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="410" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3">             <table width="405" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" align="center" bgcolor="e5e5e5">              <tr>                 <td class="small-text1" bgcolor="f0f0f0">                   <p><span class="headline"> No More Free Lunches ... and Luggage</span></p>                  <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" align="right">                    <tr>                       <td><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200." height="2"></td>                    </tr>                    <tr align="center">                       <td height="140"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/COPY.jpg" width="190" height="130"></td>                    </tr>                    <tr align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">                       <td class="tabledata">                         <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">                          <tr>                             <td class="tabledata"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">CASH                               AND CARRY</font><br>                              Freight income has risen by Rs 2,800 cr in two years</td>                          </tr>                        </table>                      </td>                    </tr>                  </table>                  <p class="tabledata">Kalka Mail is one of the 252 trains of                     the Indian Railways that run with a pantry car. Till 2004-5,                     the annual contract for the supply of food on the train was                     worth Rs 4.99 lakh. This year, the contract was renewed for                     Rs 83.60 lakh-an increase of 1,575 per cent. The train will                     run the same distance this year as it did last year and it                     will carry about as many passengers. So why did the value                     of the contract shoot up so spectacularly and so suddenly?                     Simple: till last year catering contracts on railways were                     given to applicants often on the recommendations of politicians                     and other heavyweights. Rates remained fixed at historical                     levels. Under Lalu Prasad Yadav, catering contracts are being                     given through competitive bidding. The shift from application-based                     to bidding-based contracts is proving a windfall for the railways                     (see table). This shows the crores of rupees the railways                     have been losing in the catering business. Worse, it wasn't                     even benefiting passengers, because it was the contractor                     who was feeding at the expense of the railways and taxpayers.                     Sudhir Kumar, OSD to Lalu, expects to earn over Rs 200 crore                     from catering contracts in 2005-6 which will cut accumulated                     catering losses of Rs 500 crore by 40 per cent. He hopes to                     break even next year. But this is only the tip of the earning                     potential from catering. There are about 9,000 food stalls                     on railway stations across the country, the contracts for                     which have also been doled out at abysmal rates in the past.                     For instance, the licence fee for food stalls at Howrah station                     is frozen for over a century-since 1870 to be precise. Once                     these stalls are put through competitive bidding, the railways'                     kitty could swell by Rs 1,000 crore-or more. </p>                  <p class="tabledata"> If catering losses were indefensible, parcel losses are                     almost scandalous. Every non-suburban passenger train-there                     are 4,500-runs with two brake vans. One behind the engine                     and another at the rear. These vans serve a dual purpose:                     a safety buffer in the event of a head-on or a tail-end collision                     and as parcel and luggage carrying space. Each train can carry                     16 tonnes. That multiplies to 25 million tonnes of parcel                     carrying capacity in a year in all trains. Add 7 million tonnes                     annually from dedicated parcel vans, and the total capacity                     works out to 32 million tonnes. This should earn the railways                     over Rs 3,000 crore a year. In reality, the railways loses                     over Rs 500 crore a year on the parcel business. Official                     reason: less than 20 per cent of the parcel capacity is actually                     used. Anybody who has been to the cargo area of railway platforms                     would find that hard to believe. Obviously, the luggage vans                     (or parcel vans) are running at much higher than 20 per capacity,                     only the railways is not getting paid for the parcels it carries.                     The earnings are pocketed by middlemen, inside and outside                     the railways. Here too Lalu's prescription is the same: go                     for competitive bidding. The gains have been phenomenal (see                     table). Kumar expects to wipe out losses by 2006-7 and make                     the parcel business profitable by the following year. Ironically,                     it took a man like Lalu to teach the railways how to run its                     businesses</p>                  <p class="smalltext">&nbsp;</p>                  </td>
