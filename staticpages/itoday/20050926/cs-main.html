Free of the burden of her barren sexual history, she is looking         fearlessly into a future teeming with sensual possibilities. Armed with         a curious mix of homely family values and liberal feminist notions, she         is carving out her sexual persona, telescoping that change with her emergence         as a social, not just domestic, being.</p>      <p> Rarely understood by even the most progressive parents and barely comprehended         by the boy-man who struggles to cope with her growing confidence, this         single, young urban Indian woman is challenging conventional wisdom, shaking         off years of conservatism. Call it kama sutra with karva chauth as the         ultimate end, or multiple orgasms with the mangal sutra as the prize.         Even though a majority still believes virginity is important for marriage,         India Today's poll with AC Nielsen-ORG-MARG shows that one in every four         of Indian women between the ages of 18 and 30 across 11 cities has had         sex before marriage. The age of sexual intimacy has also declined-42 per         cent had their first sexual encounter between 19 and 21, while for over         a quarter of those asked, it was as early as 15-18 years. One-third of         the women are open to having a sexual relationship with a person even         if they are not in love with him. What's more, 60 per cent of them say         sex is important in their life, in contrast to just about half of the         single women surveyed in a similar exercise in 2003 which, unlike the         present study, included married women. </p>      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="1" align="right" bgcolor="#E5E5E5" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr bgcolor="#E5E5E5">           <td colspan="3" class="mediumtext" height="30">             <table width="98%" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="2" align="center">              <tr>                 <td><span class="intro">Methodology</span> </td>              </tr>            </table>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="200" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3">             <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" align="center" bgcolor="e5e5e5">              <tr>                 <td class="tabledata" bgcolor="f0f0f0">The India Today-AC Nielsen-ORG-MARG                   Sex Survey was done to understand the sexuality of the urban                   Indian unmarried woman-what she thinks about her sexuality,                   what is her idea of sex, what are her fantasies, how many of                   them has she actually tried out, what is the level of intimacy                   and sharing with her partner and what are her sexual desires.</td>              </tr>              <tr>                 <td class="tabledata" bgcolor="f0f0f0">                   <p>The survey spoke to 2,035 unmarried women in the age group                     of 18-30 across 11 cities-Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai,                     Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Patna, Lucknow, Ludhiana, Jaipur and                     Bangalore-in upper income categories.

Women have started experimenting with their bodies. Almost 50 per cent         of the sexually experienced women have tried oral sex, compared with 33         per cent in the last survey. Sadly, it is a revolution without balladeers.         As women learn to treat their bodies as less sacred, they do not seem         able to develop a poetry which articulates this new romance. The areas         of darkness are enormous-55 per cent don't know what an orgasm is and         82 per cent say they don't masturbate. Perhaps it is because women are         just learning to love themselves, a difficult task for a gender that is         trained in the fine art of putting others first. </p>      <p> If for women, sexual liberation is the first step towards selfhood,         they are right on the path-as the survey shows, women who have had sex         seem to become more liberal than those who have not. In an awfully mad         adventure, they are learning to take the ride without the seat belt on.         Pornography appears to have become more acceptable now (only 29 per cent         believe it is wrong whereas 73 per cent condemned it in 2003). In 2003,         57 per cent said premarital sex is wrong and 78 per cent said they were         against extramarital sex. Both figures have declined, to 46 per cent and         66 per cent respectively. Surprisingly, more women seemed open to the         idea of exchanging sexual favours for a job-in 2003, 81 per cent said         they wouldn't do it. That figure is now 69 per cent.</p>      <p> Women are becoming assertive in other ways. In 2003, 61 per cent said         they would talk and sort it out if their partner was unfaithful to them,         compared with just 37 per cent now. There is widespread dissatisfaction         with the emotional responses of their partners: about half feel they are         not sensitive to their sexual needs and more than 60 per cent still have         sex without wanting to. Explaining the trends, sociologist Shiv Visvanathan         says, &quot;Women want more fun from men, and if not that, at least more         men.&quot; </p>      <table width="415" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" align="center" bgcolor="#E5E5E5">        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="415" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3" class="mediumtext" height="30" bgcolor="#E5E5E5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GUEST             COLUMN</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/emboss.gif" width="415" height="2"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="3">             <table width="415" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="7" align="center" bgcolor="e5e5e5">              <tr bgcolor="f0f0f0">                 <td class="tabledata">                   <p><span class="tabledata"><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/cs-main2.jpg" width="65" height="80" align="left"></span><span class="headline"><span class="storysubhead">Radhika                     Chopra, Sociologist</span><br>                    &quot;With Eyes Wide Open&quot;</span><br>                    <span class="intro"><br>                    Women are blending what their parents told them with their                     desires.</span></p>                  <p> A foreign couple in a bid to be &quot;Indian&quot; recently                     got married on the banks of the Pushkar Lake in Rajasthan.                     At the end of the ceremony, the bride and groom, following                     their own tradition, kissed to seal their bond. There was                     an outcry among the gathered audience. It was clear to them                     that this hybrid couple was not Indian and their ways were                     all wrong. The kiss sealed their cultural fate.</p>                  <p> Condemning kissing as &quot;foreign&quot; is arcane. For                     most young single urban Indian women and men, sex is really                     important in their lives. Venerable swadeshi ways do not rule                     their intimate lives. Blokes in the stockmarket who are in                     a constant uproar about foreign direct investment also seem                     to think that being Indian no longer implies being swadeshi.                     Non-Indian money and non-Indian business practices are ceaselessly                     chased as the engines of a dream future that will drive India                     into super serious status, giving CEOs, BPOs, Bapajis, Hellojis                     and God knows who else a place at the round tables of global                     power. But within the four walls of their homes, are all these                     raging bulls as committed to &quot;foreign ways&quot;, particularly                     for their children? Or would they rather that their offspring                     swore to remain socially swadeshi and junked any thoughts                     of going global? </p>                  <p> <img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/cs-main3.jpg" width="130" height="190" align="right">Everyone                     seems to have an opinion about what going global means for                     that all important lot-&quot;The Youth of India&quot;. They're                     wooed as consumers, admonished as spoilt brats, marked out                     as the numerically dominant face of a dramatic new demographic                     profile. Advertisers who claim to have a finger on the social                     pulse of modern Indian society have planted Shah Rukh Khan                     in a bath tub with rose petals because they are certain there                     are young women who'd like to see him naked, and in their                     tubs. They are right. Young single women do fantasise about                     film stars and The Khan in foam is likely to go down well.                   </p>                  <p> But parents whose daughters and sons are single, working                     and between the ages of 18 and 30, and who fear the fantasies                     of their children, should hold the gripe and tears. True,                     there is a seismic shift in kissing norms and sexual experiences                     that has emerged from broadening horizons-more travel, movies,                     TV channels-a cultural foreign direct investment if you will.                     But equally, young women in small towns or large metros who                     have already had their first &quot;serious&quot; relationship                     by the time they are 18 don't think highly of premarital sex                     and are only willing to consider it if they feel a commitment                     to the relationship or to their partners. According to the                     India Today-AC Nielsen-ORG-MARG survey, girls in their late                     adolescence will have kissed and held hands well before they                     were married but they are unlikely to jump into bed with the                     nearest available man. The really interesting thing about                     these young women though is their view on what sex means to                     them. For most sex is really important in their lives. But                     well over half also said that being in love was necessary                     to having sex. The great thing is that they felt as entitled                     to sexual pleasure as men, and aren't willing to grant a man                     the sole privilege of pleasure. Pyar main yeh naya twist.</p>                  <p> Most of them preferred prolonged sexual encounters to quickies                     but also thought that marriage and long term relationships                     were desirable. So even though 49 per cent of the women in                     Hyderabad, 42 per cent in Mumbai and 35 per cent in Delhi                     said they found nothing objectionable in a live-in relationship,                     they didn't think of it as an end in itself. They clearly                     felt it should lead to marriage. And while a high proportion                     still felt that a woman should remain a virgin till she married                     they weren't willing to grant &quot;extra licence&quot; to                     their potential husbands-as far as they were concerned a man                     should also not have had sex before marrying them. </p>                  <p> It's quite evident that young women think about sex with                     their eyes wide open and their minds uncluttered by preconception.                     The na&iuml;ve and gullible virgin on her first marital night                     is pass&eacute;. Big city and small town girls are clear that                     their partners should use condoms, and they couldn't care                     less about the argument that condoms decrease pleasure. There's                     a healthy fear of aids and only a minuscule percentage (8)                     said they didn't know about it. They have thought about the                     boundaries they would like to draw and what's acceptable.                     They have no compunction in saying that oral sex is all right                     because it means that women won't get pregnant or that it's                     not the same as having intercourse. </p>                  <p> They will also be able to tell you right away what part                     of a man's anatomy they find sexy-face and eyes-exploding                     the usual Hollywood myth of broad chests and butts in denim                     satisfying a woman's fantasy. Modern Indian women have clear                     sexual preferences and aren't afraid of expressing them. Single                     women in Hyderabad love to look at themselves in the mirror                     while having sex, though young girls in Bangalore, Kolkata                     and Lucknow are more conservative and rush off to bathe after                     a bout of sex, no doubt imitating their suchchi bai aunties                     in purification rituals.</p>                  <p> <img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/RADHIKA2.jpg" width="190" height="130" align="right">The                     biggest problem that young women face in their bid to be sexual                     revolutionaries is that urban public spaces are still extremely                     violent and a kissing couple in a park is likely to be stared                     at, catcalled and harassed for money or even sexually threatened.                     Since many of the girls don't share their thoughts or experiences                     about sex with their parents-in fact, many don't even tell                     their parents that they date-their own homes are not spaces                     in which they can safely meet their boyfriends. So between                     a world going global and a family seeking to remain static                     traditionalists, at least with regard to its daughters' desires,                     a young urban woman in 2005 has to scuttle between utmost                     secrecy and daring experimentation to figure out her sexual                     identity.</p>                  <p> Fortunately, young single men also seem to be more progressive.                     Premarital sex is coupled with commitment and extramarital                     sex is not okay. Half of these men think love is an essential                     ingredient in a sexual relationship and like their female                     peers expect a live-in relation to lead to marriage. They're                     less convinced about the necessity of their own virginity                     before marriage and a tad traditional in expecting a girl                     to be a virgin when she marries. But that a woman is entitled                     to sexual pleasure in bed is endorsed by a majority of young                     men, so women can heave a thankful sigh that they won't be                     faced with a slam-bam-thank you ma'am lover who pulls on his                     Jockeys and strolls away after a bout in bed. </p>                  <p> A society whose women are sexually confident is a civilised                     place. Middle class India hasn't quite got there yet. Ingesting                     a foreign world wholescale is not the view of young single                     urban women; if anything their pyar ki kahani is a creative                     post-modern process that blends what their parents told them                     and what they'd really like to know-and do.<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">                     </font></p>                  </td>              </tr>            </table>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><img src="/itoday/20050926/grfx/ITE2.jpg" width="190" height="130" align="right">Will         the emerging sexual desire teach the urban singleton to cherish her body         and soul or will it only end up in abuse? That is a secret that only the         women know. As they chart their own maps, new roadblocks will come up.         There will be attempts to chase them back into their domestic goddess         prison, with stories of single women running out of men to mate with,         as feminist Susan Faludi pointed out happened in 1980s America. There         will be attempts to paint them as the New Men, focused on money and power         in an increasingly retail culture. Indeed, in Candace Bushnell's new pulp         novel, Lipstick Jungle, success has become the new sex. If not that, the         culture of women cutting or starving themselves, already evident in the         profusion of makeover parlours, will spread. Will it force women to conform         to a body stereotype, especially with the media projecting women in an         increasingly glamorous fashion, while also reducing their body weight         by half?</p>      <p> The challenge for these young women, with their inherent caution and         their apparent modernism, will be to balance the two. There are pointers         in this survey at least. If looking good is important for women, they         are demanding it of their men too. It is writer Naomi Wolf's version of         having-it-all feminism. Or as sociologist Nishi Mitra explains, as earning         members of society, women feel they have the right to demand satisfaction.         A sexual relationship is the first way of demonstrating this. </p>      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td valign="top" width="58%">&nbsp;</td>
