      <p> Amway is a direct selling fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, whose products &ndash; Nutrition &amp; Wellness, Cosmetics, Personal Care and Home Care -- are sold to consumers directly by Amway distributors. No Amway product is available off the shelf, either retail or wholesale. With 3.6 million business owners, the company has a presence in over 80 countries, and has become one of the largest direct selling companies in the world. Established in 1959, Amway Corporation is now a US $ 8.4 billion consumer goods giant, synonymous with world-class products. Over 500 research &amp; development professionals working in over 60 labs have created &amp; have designed over 450 world class products which have earned more than 700 patents in the US and abroad, with another 500 pending. </p>
      <p>Amway India Enterprises Pvt Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amway Corporation, USA. Commencing commercial operations in May 1998 with just 5 offices and 6 products, Amway is today the country&rsquo;s largest Direct Selling company with a sales turnover of Rs. 1,407 crores( For the year ending Dec-2009); 130 offices; 115 products and 55 warehouses. The unique business opportunity is embraced by around five lakh fifty thousand people. With a robust back-end operations, Amway India is able to home deliver products to around 4000 Indian towns and cities. </p>
      <p>Amway India has invested in excess of US $ 35 million (Rs. 151 crore) in India. The Company has over 450 full-time employees in India and has created additional 1650 indirect jobs. In the last financial year, Amway paid close to Rs 250 crores in taxes. </p>
      <p>The Amway business is truly a great leveler in the sense that any individual speaking any language and with any level of education, can succeed. Which is why Amway distributors in the North-East, or the Andamans, or Ladakh or in towns and cities across India, are determined to make their businesses succeed. </p>
      <p>This concept of direct selling enables greater numbers of people to increase their income-generating capacity, instead of it being limited to large malls or shop-owners. Whereas it may take lakhs to start a traditional business (shop or showroom), it costs a fraction to register as an Amway distributor, without the accompanying infrastructure issues, such as sales assistants or accountants, or stores, as most of this responsibility is taken care of by Amway. </p>
      <p>Amway India is also an equal opportunity partner with all its vendors. Not only has it grown as a commercial entity, it has also ensured that its partners have grown along with it. One of Amway&rsquo;s earliest vendors in India was a Rs 5 crore outfit when it joined hands with Amway. It now has a turnover in excess of Rs 120 crores. </p>
      <p>Between the definitions of product manufacture, and entrepreneurial development, Amway also fulfils its responsibility to society. This is evident from the activities of Amway Opportunity Foundation (AOF) a registered non-profit organization which spear heads the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives of Amway India. Under the &ldquo;National Project for the Blind&rdquo;, AOF has ensured that 85,000 visually challenged children, in schools across 12 Indian states, have access to Braille textbooks. It has also set up 13 computer/vocational centres for visually challenged children. In Another project &ndash; &ldquo;National Project for Children&rdquo; AOF has partnered with 57 needy children&rsquo;s home/orphanages to support the educational, health and hygiene needs of the children of the identified home. All Amway employees and distributors are volunteers of AOF, and this massive force has done the Company proud by its involvement. Consider the following </p>
      <p>. <strong>Consider the following:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 450 blood donation camps where around 45,000 units of blood have been donated </li>
        <li>Over Rs 1 crore collected and utilized during times of natural calamities (Gujarat earthquake, the destruction wrecked by the Tsunami etc.        </li>
