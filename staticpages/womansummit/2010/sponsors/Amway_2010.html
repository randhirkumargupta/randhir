      <p> Amway India Enterprises Pvt Ltd is the Indian affiliate of Amway Corporation, Michigan, USA. Established in 1959 Amway Corporation is now a US $ 8.2 billion consumer goods giant, synonymous with world-class products. 450 research &amp; development professionals working in over 60 labs have created and designed over 450 superior quality products.</p>
      <p>Amway is a direct selling fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, whose products &mdash; home care, personal care, nutrition &amp; wellness and cosmetics &mdash; are sold to consumers directly by Amway distributors. No Amway product is available off the shelf, either retail or wholesale. With 3.6 million business owners, the company has a presence in over 80 countries, and has become one of the largest direct selling companies in the world.</p>
      <p>Amway India Enterprises Pvt Ltd commenced commercial operations in May 1998. With offices in over 130 towns and cities and a turnover of Rs. 1407 crore in 2009, it is today, the largest Direct Selling FMCG Company in India. The unique business provides income-generating opportunity to around five lakh fifty thousand Indian Amway Business Owners, who are active in selling 115 world class products to Indian consumers. These products are also home delivered to around 4000 Indian towns and cities.</p>
      <p>Amway India has invested in excess of US $ 35 million (Rs. 151 crore) in India. The Company has over 450 full-time employees in India and has created additional 1650 indirect jobs. In the last financial year, Amway paid close to Rs 250 crores in taxes.</p>
      <p>The Amway business is truly a great leveler in the sense that any individual speaking any language and with any level of education, can succeed. Which is why Amway distributors in the North-East, or the Andamans, or Ladakh or in towns and cities across India, are determined to make their businesses succeed.</p>
      <p>This concept of direct selling enables greater numbers of people to increase their income-generating capacity, instead of this being limited to large malls or shop-owners. Whereas it may take lakhs to start a business (shop or showroom) it costs a fraction to register as an Amway distributor, without the accompanying infrastructure issues, such as sales assistants or accountants, or stores, as most of this responsibility is taken care of by Amway.</p>
      <p>Amway India is also a socially responsible corporate house. Not only has it grown as a commercial entity, it has also ensured that its partners have grown along with it. One of Amway's earliest vendors was a Rs 5 crore outfit when it joined hands with Amway. It now has a turnover in excess of Rs 120 crores!</p>
      <p>Its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) effort is spear-headed by the Amway Opportunity Foundation (AOF) a registered non-profit organization. AOF has ensured that 85,000 visually challenged children, in schools across 12 Indian states, have access to Braille textbooks. It has also set up eight computer centres for visually challenged children. All Amway employees and distributors are volunteers of AOF, and this massive force has done the Company proud by it's involvement. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Over 450 blood donation camps where around 45,000 units of blood have been donated</li>
        <li>56 institutions and Homes for children supported under Project Sunrise</li>
        <li>Over Rs 1 crore collected and utilized during times of natural calamities (Gujarat earthquake, the destruction wrecked by the Tsunami etc)<br>
                  </li>
