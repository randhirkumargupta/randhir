      <p> If ever an artist was told to depict the perfect Indian woman, he would without even realizing it adorn her with gold. To separate the two is impossible; some would even go so afar as to say, inauspicious. For she is gold &ndash; radiant and resilient, shaping herself like the jewel of the time, transforming herself with history, spreading her wisdom everywhere, from the inner courtyards of little hamlets to the boardrooms of large corporations. If the woman of an Indian household bedecked herself with gold, it is said to have indicated many things &ndash; that the family was prosperous, that she was happy, and that she had the time to celebrate her womanhood. The daughter who drove the car to college, the mother who secured the family business, the daughter-in-law who is consulted before any investment is made, the wife who advised her husband and her brother, guardian of the family purse-string, she earns, spends, saves, and supports. Homemaker, breadwinner, she is Lakshmi, embodiment of beauty and fortune.. We at the World Gold Council call her the real woman!</p>
      <p>World Gold Council is an association of the world's leading gold producers dedicated to the promotion of gold. Founded in the year 1987 and headquartered in London, it is represented by a network of offices in the major centres of gold demand around the world and its promotional activities cover markets representing some three quarters of the world's annual consumption of gold. The Council&rsquo;s aim is to stimulate and sustain the demand for gold and to create enduring value for its stakeholders - consumers, investors, the industry and the official sector. It is funded by the world&rsquo;s leading gold mining companies. For further information visit www.gold.org</p>
