   <strong> OMEGA - THE LEGACY OF A BRAND</strong>

 <p>

Founded in 1848, OMEGA has always been dedicated to creating watches whose blend of innovative technology and design excellence reflects the company's proud legacy while defining the future of watchmaking. 
</p>
<p><strong>Cornerstones</strong></p>
<p>
OMEGA was built on the cornerstones of industrialization, precision, aesthetic design and quality. When the company started to industrialize its movements in the late 19th century, the founders moved out of the small workshops and studios in the mountains to the brand's current location in Biel. 
</p>
 
<p>
OMEGA's quest for precision led to its domination of the observatory trials in the 20th century and today, precision remains an essential part of the brand's identity.
</p>
 
<p>
OMEGA has always been at the forefront of outstanding watch design. It has won countless awards and its iconic designs have influenced the entire industry.  Its dedication to aesthetic excellence matches its commitment to innovative watchmaking technology.
</p>
 
<p>
The consideration of quality is part of every production decision taken by OMEGA. Each tiny component of an OMEGA watch is crafted to the industry's most exacting quality standards.  
</p>
 
<p><strong>Pioneering Spirit</strong></p>
<p>
OMEGA is largely defined by its pioneering spirit - consider its conquests of space (including six lunar landings) and the oceans' depths and more recently, its commitment to humanitarian causes with implications for the whole planet. 
</p>
 
<p>
Today, OMEGA's pioneering spirit has a social and ecological focus, with projects in support of oceanic health with the GoodPlanet Foundation, fighting blindness with ORBIS</p> 

 
<p>
International and finding alternatives to non-renewable fuels with its Solar Impulse partners.
</p>
 
<p><strong>Sports Timekeeping</strong></p>
<p>
OMEGA has served as Official Olympic Timekeeper 25 times in a relationship with the IOC and the world's finest athletes which began in 1932. OMEGA's sports timing specialists have been behind the development of much of the equipment used to measure the results in international competitions including starting blocks, touch pads in swimming pools and refined photofinish cameras. 
</p>
 
<p><strong>The Co-Axial Story</strong></p>
<p>
OMEGA's Co-Axial escapement launched in 1999 was the first practical new watch escapement introduced in some 250 years. The OMEGA Co-Axial movements introduced in 2007 deliver a level of chronometric performance and stability unmatched by any other industrialized mechanical watch movement.   
</p>
 
<p><strong>OMEGA - Saluting a history, defining the future </strong></p>
<p>
Every OMEGA watch is created to the highest standards of contemporary horology but the brand is ever mindful that each of its timepieces is a proud descendent of a noble watchmaking history that can be traced back to 1848.
