      <p> <em>Mail Today</em> is a morning daily with a difference, launched by the India Today Group in a joint venture with the <em>Daily Mail</em> of UK in an exciting new format and style. It is bold, insightful and relevant from a truly national perspective. An irreverent paper, it is unsparing in its opinion and news coverage, no matter who or what the subject. Mail Today is an intelligent person's newspaper that provides the full story behind the news through bold and vigorous reportage, cutting-edge analysis, high production values and stylish visual content.<br>
      Mail Today goes well beyond the lukewarm bite-sized news items that fail to adequately address the issues and events of the day. Clean, lucid and straight-talking, <em>Mail Today</em> marries the credibility and authenticity of the India Today Group with the<em> Daily Mail</em>'s international standards. All this has made Mail Today the fastest growing daily in Delhi according to the latest Indian Readership Survey (IRS). With a circulation of more than 2 lakh copies Mail Today has become an integral part of the daily diet of Delhi. </p>
      <p><em>Mail Today</em> - An engaging read that makes good mornings just great.<br>
