<p>Having spent her childhood in the hills of Nilgiris, Dr. Blossom Kochhar's love for nature and her belief in the power of natural, alternate lifestyle inspired her to lay the foundations of Blossom Kochhar Aroma Magic (BKAM)</p>
<p>In fact, her belief and love for all things natural promoted her curiosity and openness to an alternate way of living and healing. This inspired her to build a company around it, using fragrance, colours, plant extracts, organic ingredients and ancient herbal remedies which are so familiar and interwoven in everyday living in India. She created a range of honest skin, hair and well being products delivering meaningful, effective results that has a positive and healing effect on the mind, body and soul.</p>
<p>She was joined in her pursuit of creation by her husband, the late Col. V. Kochhar and her daughter, Samantha (presently the Managing Director) after his demise. The journey began by creating products for her training academy, later on various salons and spas across the country and gradually over the years Aroma Magic forayed into the retail market.</p>
<p>Her style and perspective is reflected in all that the Company holds good, creates and stands for. Every formulation, packaging, belief and action has its roots firmly entrenched in healing, art, design, fashion, culture, history, artistic and scientific harmony, the contrast and making sustainable, responsible lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>Although the Company continues to grow,  its  roots are firmly planted in the beginning as a family owned business, guided by the same desire for quality products and a green, sustainable future. It is the Company's belief that sometimes one whiff of change can make a difference in the way people think and live their lives. It is hoped that BKAM can be instrumental in such a life empowering movement for the planet and its people.</p>
