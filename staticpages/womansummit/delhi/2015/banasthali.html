    <p>Banasthali originated in only of its kind circumstances when a father lost his promising daughter and decided to train others the same way. The concept of education for a girl child virtually didn't exist at that time. The founders went door to door to recruit students. There was no question for charging any fee for the initial few decades.</p>
    <p>With that humble beginning, today it stands as one of the world's largest fully residential women's university having more than 11000 students on its 850-acre campus situated amidst rural setting in Rajasthan and having a distinct educational ideology and offering a variety of programmes from nursery up to doctoral level across a wide spectrum of disciplines to prepare enlightened citizens with strong value-base.</p>
    <p>Vidyapith's alumni have became governors, ministers, parliament/assembly speakers, leading business personalities, noted academic, international athletes and distinguished national artists and musicians.</p>
