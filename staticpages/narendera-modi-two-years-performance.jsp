Two years on, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is getting the measure of that Biblical saying as he spends time taking daily reviews of the performance of his government and chalks out what he needs to do in the remaining three years.</p><p>At a recent meeting of his council of ministers, Modi turned testy about the delays in implementing many of the decisions and policies of his government. He pointed out that even while an Act is being prepared for parliamentary approval, the concerned ministry should formulate rules so that there is no time-lag between the President giving his assent and the people benefitting from it. He cited the amendment moved by his government to give greater protection to SC/STs that received presidential assent on January 1 but was gazetted only on January 26.</p><p>Those who have wandered through the Indian bureaucratic and judicial labyrinth would think that getting anything done in three weeks is superfast. Not so an impatient Modi, who has always been a man in a tearing hurry and believes that work on a scheme should begin the day after it is announced. May 26 will mark the completion of his two years in what is arguably the globe's most difficult job-fulfilling the aspirations of a billion-plus people in the world's largest democracy. Modi remains acutely aware that he has been given a decisive mandate that no prime minister has been bestowed with since Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 and appears determined to take the million little steps needed to transform the country.</p><p>In the over 700 days that he has been in office, Modi seems indefatigable, though exhausting for those who work with him. He outpaces his younger colleagues by looking peppy even after gruelling Cabinet meetings that go past dinner-time. He has clocked more miles in India and abroad than anyone else in the government. And his appetite for out-of-the box ideas and new programmes remains insatiable. At last count, he had announced, with much fanfare, 30 major initiatives that ranged from cleaning India to saving the girl child, from smart cities to lighting up villages, and from skilling youth to helping start-up enterprises. In terms of numbers, Modi has already outpaced Indira Gandhi's famed 20-point programme and Rajiv Gandhi's six Technology Missions.</p><p>Modi is in command and going at full throttle. He runs the government very much like a CEO of a large business house would, setting the agenda, demanding accountability, and bulldozing his way through red tape and chatter. Hamstrung by a limited talent pool (many of his ministers are first-timers), in his first year, the prime minister relied on an alliance with the civil service, making the PMO allpowerful in taking decisions and monitoring results. That tight control may have given rise to lots of grumbling and carping about too much centralisation, but it has ensured that his government has not been rocked by any major scandals. Those in the know concede that corruption at the top level has been considerably reduced as compared with the UPA government.</p><p>In his second year, he began pushing his ministers hard to focus on outcomes and delivery. Some of the hesitancy that Modi showed in his first year gave way to a quiet confidence as he was much more sure of himself. Modi is also far more aware of the complexities of managing a country where you can give orders but have no guarantee that they will be followed at lower levels. He now appears far more realistic about his abilities to achieve transformation on a major scale. Instead of relying solely on his massive mandate, he is aware that he now has to focus on rootand-branch reforms.</p><p>Like Winston Churchill, Modi believes that consistency is the virtue of mules. In his first year as PM, he criticised the previous government's programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and Aadhaar. But, by the second year, he had embraced both wholeheartedly, claiming that his government had made delivery more efficient.</p><p>Nor has he shied away from doing the unorthodox. If his predecessor Manmohan Singh debated for two terms on whether or not to pay a visit to Pakistan, Modi made an impromptu stopover at Lahore to greet Nawaz Sharif on his birthday and attend his grandchild's wedding on Christmas Day last year. It may have got flak at home but did much to set right India's obdurate image in the eyes of the world.</p><p> That Modi has learnt well on the job and become more creative within the limitations is evident in his second year in office. There was a marked shift in the recent Budget towards a pro-poor and pro-farmer approach to dent criticism by the Opposition that it was a "suit-boot ki sarkar". He announced the largest profarmer schemes since Independence to improve the safety net for crop failure and promote irrigation schemes, even while maintaining fiscal prudence. It was much-needed relief for the farm sector because, while his government may have received a bonanza from low oil prices, Modi had to contend with two continuous years of bad monsoons-the first 'double drought' in 30 years-that had left much of rural India impoverished.</p><p> On the economic front, one may quibble about calculation methods but the fact is that annual GDP growth is an impressive 7.6 per cent even as global growth rates remain tepid. Compared to the final years of the UPA, the Modi government has worked hard to shore up India's image abroad and restore investor confidence. When he took over two years ago, Modi was confronted by a corporate sector whose balance sheets were over-leveraged, a banking sector weighed down by non-performing assets (NPAs), and a global financial crisis that caused exports to plummet. </p><p> In Modi's calculus, this may not have been the ideal time to launch Big Bang Margaret Thatcher-like reforms that he had promised during the campaign. He seems to have chosen a policy of economic gradualism instead. His decisions reflect an excessive amount of pragmatism rather than the underpinning of any strong economic vision. He is driven by a quest for efficiency that focuses on processes to ensure ease and speed of doing business.</p><p>Despite having reservations over Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan's tight monetary control, Modi stayed the course and ensured that basic economic management remained sound, including keeping inflation low, stabilising the rupee and maintaining the current account and fiscal deficit targets.</p><p>He has also ensured that funding for infrastructure to facilitate business and farmers has been more than adequate. Whether it is railways, highways, ports, power plants or petroleum, all these sectors have received major doses of funds, with Modi personally monitoring the progress. It is not surprising that his key economic and infrastructure ministers such as Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Suresh Prabhu, Dharmendra Pradhan and Piyush Goyal have been rated highly in terms of performance by the india today team in the following pages. Overall, while there is much left to be done in the remaining years, Modi deserves high marks for his management of the economy.</p><p>On foreign policy, an area in which he had little experience, Modi has done surprisingly well. He has become skillful in leveraging foreign policy for domestic development. Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar likens Modi's frequent voyages abroad to famed former Japanese leader Tomomi Iwakura's mission to study industry, institutions and best practices abroad in the first two years of his rule and then using that knowledge to modernise Japan after the Meiji restoration in the 19th century. Modi has been on a non-stop tour of major capitals to not only shore up India's flagging image abroad but also to hardsell India as an attractive investment destination. His visits to 12 countries in 2014-2015 yielded an impressive 20 billion dollars in foreign direct investment. Jaishankar compares Modi's focus on foreign policy to that of Jawarharlal Nehru, who had actively sought help from other countries to build India's economic base.</p><p>Modi's neighbourhood-first approach may have hit roadblocks in Pakistan but he has cemented relations with Bangladesh by signing the historic Land Boundary Agreement, improved ties with Bhutan and Myanmar, and recovered ground in Afghanistan and the Maldives. On Pakistan, while he has been criticised for making several U-turns, he has stuck by his promise of seeking good relations with Islamabad if it reined in its terror apparatus. Part of the problem is that Nawaz Sharif has lost considerable ground to the Pakistan Army, which has been resistant to any dramatic improvement in ties with India. Where Modi has made significant strides is in the energy-rich Middle East and in Central Asia, where India had little traction or clout in the past. Of the major powers, a new equilibrium has been reached with China after some hiccups, economic ties have been boosted with Russia, and Modi has built an excellent rapport with US President Barack Obama.</p><p>But the flip side is that a number of former prime ministers had announced major reforms or policy changes in their first two years in office, be it Narasimha Rao's liberalisation policy, Atal Behari Vajpayee's Pokhran-II nuclear test, or Manmohan Singh's initiation of the India-US nuclear deal. To that extent, Modi has missed a trick and lost some early momentum.</p><p>While the Modi sarkar is rated highly when it comes to the economy, infrastructure and foreign policy, its overall performance has been dragged down on two major fronts: political and social. Modi's political instincts are finely honed and helped him almost single-handedly lead the party to a commanding majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. But, once in power, he has allowed himself to be flat-footed on many occasions. The BJP's quest for 'Congress-mukt Bharat' has come at the cost of an almost non-functional Parliament, where major bills such as Land Acquisition and GST ran aground, with Modi engaging in direct attacks on the Gandhi family. While his personal popularity remains high and Modi is miles ahead of any other BJP leader in terms of stature, major electoral setbacks in Delhi and Bihar have punctured his aura of invincibility and made him more vulnerable to pressures from the RSS. </p><p>His diminishing ability to deliver in the state polls may have encouraged the extreme elements in the Sangh Parivar to divert attention from his development focus. He may, like Churchill, maintain that "you will never get to the end of the journey if you stop to shy a stone at every dog that barks". But there were occasions when he should have stamped these elements out decisively as an example for the rest. Instead, he allowed the RSS and the BJP to speed ahead on such divisive issues as patriotism and the beef ban in the hope that a more muscular approach would mobilise votes. L.K. Advani had learnt the limits of such tactics in the '90s. If Modi doesn't learn soon enough, his goal of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat will remain a hollow promise.</p><p>While india today gives Modi a silver medal for his allround performance, to go for gold, he must strengthen the areas that gave him ballast and curb the problems that are dragging him down. Clearly, the economy, development and social upliftment should remain his top priorities. The rising discontent, whether among the Jats or the Patidars, and the strife surrounding Rohith Vemula's suicide and of Kanhaiya Kumar's arrest, is indicative of a growing unrest over the lack of employment opportunities and social development. Modi needs to focus on speedy implementation of all the major initiatives that he has launched. Schemes such as Start-up India that are ideal to harness the entrepreneurial spirit of a vast nation and provide jobs need timely and institutional support if they are to succeed.</p><p>Apart from announcing motherhood-and-apple pie objectives, Modi needs to articulate clearly how his government expects to achieve them. He should work towards a more cohesive vision where pro-poor and pro-market are considered mutually supportive rather than exclusive. An economic liberalism that services development and the poor at the same time-something an India in search of inspiration would latch on to. That shows the country is moving on from the Congress idea of doles and handouts to a more sustainable economy that provides genuine jobs and brings pride to the average citizen. There are also plenty of laggards heading crucial ministries (see accompanying pages) and he must tell his colleagues to shape up or have them shipped them out forthwith.</p><p>What makes Modi's task easier is that the nation still believes he is the man with the answers and the wherewithal. On that there are still no second thoughts. How Modi performs in the third year will lay the justification for a second term. </p><p><em>-By Raj Chengappa</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="gold-common-section"><div class="common-row"><h2>Panchratna</h2><ul><li><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/thumb-img01.jpg" alt=""/><h3>Arun Jaitley</h3><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="goldpopbox1" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'IT_narendera-modi-two-years_Page', 'click','Arun Jaitley', 1, {'nonInteraction': 1});return true;">READ MORE</a><div id="goldpopbox1" class="gold-popupbox" style="display:none;"><a href="#" class="close"></a><div class="top-pop-row"><h4>Panchratna</h4></div><div class="outer-box" style="height:700px; overflow:scroll; overflow-x:hidden;"><div class="bot-pop-row"><h5>High on Fiscal Fitness</h5><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/thumb-img01.jpg" alt=""/><h2>Arun Jaitley</h2><span class="rating"><a href="#" style="width:80%;"></a></span><span class="clear"></span><h3><em>63,</em> Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs</h3><div class="pop-content"><p>Arun Jaitley looks remarkably fit-in fact, fitter and younger than he has looked in years. Dressed in an aqua blue kurta-pyjama on the Sunday morning we meet him, it is clear that the past two years as India's finance minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-hand man are suiting him admirably.</p><p> Being the finance minister is an onerous job, especially when the external environment is hostile. But Jaitley is not just the finance minister of the NDA government, he is also its troubleshooter-in-chief, prime negotiator with the Opposition and the man tasked with managing the government's media image. Some of his admirers, and many of his critics, say he is the closest the NDA government has to what the UPA had in Pranab Mukherjee. Critics use the Pranab comparison to point out that Jaitley is too busy to actually steer the finance ministry or bring out a great budget. His admirers say there is practically no one in the current government who can wear the FM's hat successfully while juggling many other balls in the air.</p><p>Within the first few months of Modi taking charge, it became clear that Jaitley had emerged as his key confidant in the government, more than any other colleague. Apart from finance, he was also given charge of the defence ministry till a suitable candidate was found.</p><p>From time to time, there are murmurs that Jaitley is falling out of favour with Modi. The latest evidence his detractors offer is that Subramanian Swamy, with whom Jaitley has never been on the best of terms, is now leading the charge in the Rajya Sabha on AgustaWestland although Jaitley is the leader of the BJP in the upper house.</p><p>As finance minister, Jaitley has a mixed record. He took charge when oil prices had plunged globally, giving the government much-needed breathing room, while inflation was also slowly coming down due to the global commodities crash. However, it was also a time when the global economy was in turmoil, domestic growth rates had slowed and corporate performance was down in the dumps. Moreover, he had to contend with two years of bad monsoons, huge rural distress and a big problem in non-performing assets of public sector banks. Given these constraints, Jaitley has managed to walk the tightrope. He has kept a rein on spending and managed to stick to the stiff fiscal deficit targets. He has used the oil bonanza to push up infrastructure spending. FDI is up to a sevenyear high and India stands out with a 7.5 per cent growth rate when the rest of the world is struggling with sub-3 per cent rates. While he has not been credited with any spectacular reforms, many economists say a steady hand is what's needed in the current global economic flux.</p><p>On the parliamentary front, where he is tasked with steering important bills and negotiating with the Opposition, he has been less successful. Changes to the Land Acquisition Act had to be dumped, the GST Bill is stuck and the Aadhaar Act got passed only because it was introduced as a money bill, circumventing the necessity of steering it through the Rajya Sabha. Most people, though, praise the Bankruptcy Code that has just cleared the Lok Sabha and will go to the upper house.</p><p>Eventually though, Jaitley's reputation as finance minister will depend on whether he manages to push the two critical economic bills-GST and the Bankruptcy Code-through the Rajya Sabha. He hopes to do both in July, when the Congress may have lost a few Rajya Sabha seats.</p><p><em>-by Shweta Punj</em></p></div></div></div></div></li><li><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-3-4-Gadkari-May23-1.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="111"/><h3>Nitin Gadkari</h3><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="goldpopbox2" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'IT_narendera-modi-two-years_Page', 'click','Nitin Gadkari', 1, {'nonInteraction': 1});return true;">READ MORE</a><div id="goldpopbox2" class="gold-popupbox" style="display:none;"><a href="#" class="close"></a><div class="top-pop-row"><h4>Panchratna</h4></div><div class="outer-box" style="height:700px; overflow:scroll; overflow-x:hidden;"><div class="bot-pop-row"><h5>Roads Scholar</h5><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-3-4-Gadkari-May23-1.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="111"/><h2>Nitin Gadkari</h2><span class="rating"><a href="#" style="width:93%;"></a></span><span class="clear"></span><h3><em>60,</em> Minister for Road Transport, Highways & Shipping</h3><div class="pop-content"><p>Afew months after Nitin Gadkari took over as the Union minister for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping, Larsen & Toubro's executive chairman A.M. Naik went to him with a serious grievance. Naik said L&T was planning to withdraw from the roads sector because projects were being rendered unfeasible due to delays. Two years later, the partnership is still going strong, with L&T involved in eight road construction projects worth Rs 15,000 crore. "Gadkari has done a good job of removing bottlenecks and putting projects on a fast track. Even banks whose funds were held up are happy with him," Naik tells india today.</p><p>Apart from praise from several private players, numbers too reflect the turnaround. In 2014, Gadkari set a twoyear target of constructing 30 km of roads every day. Compared with the 2 km per day at the time, down from 7 km per day a year earlier-this was considered utterly unachievable. Though he may have not hit the 30 km mark, road construction clocked 21 km per day last week. "Setting a high target is seen as a political gimmick. But I purposely do it to gear up the bureaucracy's vision to get the best results," Gadkari says.</p><p>More than 90 per cent of the 380-odd projects that were delayed when he came into office (worth over Rs 3.50 lakh crore) are now off the ground. These include the Delhi-Jaipur highway (which was three years behind schedule); the Nagpur-Jabalpur highway (pending completion for almost a decade due to lack of forest clearances); and the Muzaffarnagar-Dehradun highway (lagging by four years). Gadkari's affability and style of winning people over rather than cracking the whip have paid off. His Cabinet colleagues and party workers see him as approachable and open to ideas, and his officers see him as a boss who allows them to work freely and without fear of censure.</p><p>With time, Gadkari's vision for roads is widening. In all new projects, worth Rs 1.50 lakh crore, one per cent of the cost is reserved for planting trees and beautification. Five hundred truck terminals are being planned on major highways- each with dhabas, rest rooms, parking for 200 trucks and repair stations. But one major hurdle remains. A judicial system that can rule on road project disputes, particularly land acquisition issues, is far from being in place.</p><p>Ports and shipping, too, are looking up. Twelve major ports and the three main PSUs in the shipping sector made a joint operating profit of more than Rs 6,000 crore in 2015, the highest in any financial year. But the Sagarmala project, which aims at port-led industrial development, port modernisation, connectivity and coastal community development, has not yet taken off.</p><p>One of Gadkari's pet schemes is to develop water transport in 116 rivers. A Rs 4,000 crore project to develop the 1,600-km Varanasi-Haldia Ganga waterway is about to be awarded. It will have three terminals, at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia, with railway and road connectivity for each. Twenty floating and 20 permanent jetties are also in the works.</p><p>The total investments taken up by the NDA government in ports is around Rs 70,000 crore, with another big push coming at the Maritime India Summit organised by Gadkari in Mumbai last month, when MoUs worth Rs 82,000 crore were signed. "Our target is simple-bring down logistics costs by using ports and waterways," he says. "Wait and see, this will boost the GDP as well!" His enthusiasm is infectious. </p><p><em>-by Uday Mahurkar</em></p></div></div></div></div></li><li><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-5-6-Prabhu-May23-1.jpg" width="180" height="111" alt=""/><h3>Suresh Prabhu</h3><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="goldpopbox3" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'IT_narendera-modi-two-years_Page', 'click','Suresh Prabhu', 1, {'nonInteraction': 1});return true;">READ MORE</a><div id="goldpopbox3" class="gold-popupbox" style="display:none;"><a href="#" class="close"></a><div class="top-pop-row"><h4>Panchratna</h4></div><div class="outer-box" style="height:700px; overflow:scroll; overflow-x:hidden;"><div class="bot-pop-row"><h5>Coupe d'etat</h5><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-5-6-Prabhu-May23-1.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="111"/><h2>Suresh Prabhu</h2><span class="rating"><a href="#" style="width:80%;"></a></span><span class="clear"></span><h3><em>62,</em> Minister for Railways</h3><div class="pop-content"><p>There hasn't been a worse time to be railway minister in India. The global economic slowdown has reduced exports, hitting railway revenue from freight it uses to subsidise passenger travel. Railways continue to lose out to road transport-less than 32 per cent of Indian freight is now carried on rail. The ministry's already stressed finances- it currently spends 92 paise to earn a rupee-are set to take a Rs 32,000 crore hit this year. And then there's the amount it will have to shell out for pay hikes to its 1.3 million employees when it implements the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations.</p><p>The light at the end of the tunnel, arguably, is Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu who took over as railway minister six months into NDA-II's tenure. Having the unenviable task of turning the railways around, Prabhu has risen to the challenge by setting a blistering pace of minor and major reform within a monolith that's remained largely unchanged since the days of the Raj. The single biggest change Prabhu has brought in has been to end the exploitation of railways as a milch cow for short-term political benefits-doling out jobs, starting new trains and awarding railway contracts. He has opted instead to turn it into the workhorse of the Indian economy.</p><p>The minister has delegated decisionmaking to railway officials to prevent delays. An internal survey shows that decision time has shrunk from an average of 500 days to 80. Projects are now approved in six months as against 24 months earlier. Faster decisions mean swifter project completion-broad gauge line commissioning between 2015 and 2016 increased by 85 per cent compared to 2009-14; at Rs 93,795 crore, railways have doubled spending on new infrastructure over last year.</p><p>The railways had geared up to handle 1.2 billion tonnes of cargo this year, its highest ever, but it never materialised. "I am unfazed by constraints," says the technocrat who trained as a lawyer and a chartered accountant. "That word does not exist in my dictionary." What does is new revenue streams. This year, the ministry earned Rs 9,600 crore in 'non-fare revenue'. A new directorate will look at mopping up cash from all other sources, including vinyl-wrapped trains, the first Rajdhanis to run this year swathed in advertising.</p><p>The semi-high speed Gatiman Express runs at 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra. Imported Spanish passenger trains which can run at 200 kmph on the existing tracks and slash Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani train journey times to just 12 hours are set to begin trials in India this month.</p><p>Prabhu's office runs the NDA's largest social media outreach. Three shifts of four officers each attend to thousands of passenger complaints. This is part of the short-term focus to improve passenger comfort and travel. Cleanliness of trains and stations has improved. Prabhu has set time-bound goals like eliminating all level crossings by 2019 and ensuring zero waste discharge on tracks.</p><p>The long-term vision will come from the new railway planning and investment organisation being set up. It will set its medium- and long-term goals, including the National Railway Plan 2030.</p><p>But the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow Prabhu is hunkering down for is the Dedicated Freight Corridor, over 3,200 km of special freight lines forming a Mumbai-Delhi-Kolkata triangle that will allow goods train speeds to quadruple, considerably reducing freight costs and make the railways competitive again.</p><p><em>-by Sandeep Unnithan</em></p></div></div></div></div></li><li><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-7-8-Piyush-Goyal-May23-1.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="111"/><h3>Piyush Goyal</h3><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="goldpopbox4" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'IT_narendera-modi-two-years_Page', 'click','Piyush Goyal', 1, {'nonInteraction': 1});return true;">READ MORE</a><div id="goldpopbox4" class="gold-popupbox" style="display:none;"><a href="#" class="close"></a><div class="top-pop-row"><h4>Panchratna</h4></div><div class="outer-box" style="height:700px; overflow:scroll; overflow-x:hidden;"><div class="bot-pop-row"><h5>Young King Coal</h5><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-7-8-Piyush-Goyal-May23-1.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="111"/><h2>Piyush Goyal</h2><span class="rating"><a href="#" style="width:80%;"></a></span><span class="clear"></span><h3><em>51,</em> MoS (independent charge) for Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy</h3><div class="pop-content"><p>Piyush Goyal is one member of Narendra Modi's cabinet who is always bubbling with energy. The Union minister for power, coal and renewable energy is seen checking his phone every few minutes. And not because he is distracted, but because he keeps getting alerts about a spectrum of data and real-time information related to his ministry. These include daily coal production numbers from all of India's 100 major power plants, the number of power-efficient LED bulbs sold at any given time and real-time data on the progress in electrification of the 18,000 villages that were still without power when the NDA came to power two summers ago.</p><p>It is a period in which Goyal has used technology for accountability, put in unprecedented transparency norms in a sector that had witnessed major corruption scandals in recent years, and opened the doors to renewable energy to keep up with a world facing the challenge of climate change.</p><p>The statistics lend credence to Goyal's success story. During 2014-15, India produced 31 million tonnes of coal, equivalent to coal production in the previous four years. In 2014, coal stocks in 66 major power plants were at a critical level, which means there were stocks of less than seven days. Today, the plants have stocks for around 25 days on average.</p><p>India's power deficit stands at 2.4 per cent as compared to 4.2 per cent when he took over. The sale of LED bulbs has jumped from six lakh annually to six lakh a day. And while the CAG had calculated a potential loss of Rs 1.86 crore to the exchequer due to corruption and irregularities in allotment of coal mines in the UPA regime, auctions after the Supreme Court's directions will fetch Rs 1.96 lakh crore to the exchequer during the next 30 years. "Our mantra is surplus, cheap and environment-friendly power, with transparency," Goyal tells india today.</p><p>Power is on the Concurrent List, which means both the Centre and states have jurisdiction over various aspects. One of Goyal's biggest challenges was getting several Opposition-ruled states on board with the government's directives. He won them over with an attractive discom (state power distribution companies) revival package called UDAY, which provides huge reliefs to state governments and discoms in paying interest on loans. In return, UDAY binds the states and the discoms to deploy smart meters and launch campaigns against power theft. Eighteen states have already come on board. "Politics is all about power, but I am taking power out of politics," Goyal says. At the time of NDA taking over, the total discom loss stood at Rs 3.20 crore.</p><p>The road ahead is still rocky. Targets for his ministries remain formidable- doubling coal production to one billion tonnes per year, increasing power generation by 50 per cent by 2020, increasing renewable energy capacity five times by 2022, and increasing energy saving to 10 per cent of the current energy consumption by 2020.</p><p>"The turnaround in the power sector is real, and it touches almost every sphere of the sector," says Ashok Jhunjhunwala, a power expert who teaches at IIT Madras. "There is, however, still some way to go when one talks of electricity without breakdown for the entire country." This is the dream that Goyal is now chasing.</p><p><em>-by Uday Mahurkar</em></p></div></div></div></div></li><li><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-9-10-Pradhan-May23-1.jpg" width="180" height="111" alt=""/><h3>Dharmendra Pradhan</h3><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="goldpopbox5" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'IT_narendera-modi-two-years_Page', 'click','Dharmendra Pradhan', 1, {'nonInteraction': 1});return true;">READ MORE</a><div id="goldpopbox5" class="gold-popupbox" style="display:none;"><a href="#" class="close"></a><div class="top-pop-row"><h4>Panchratna</h4></div><div class="outer-box" style="height:700px; overflow:scroll; overflow-x:hidden;"><div class="bot-pop-row"><h5>Oil's Well</h5><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Outstanding-9-10-Pradhan-May23-1.jpg" width="180" height="111" alt=""/><h2>Dharmendra Pradhan</h2><span class="rating"><a href="#" style="width:80%;"></a></span><span class="clear"></span><h3><em>46,</em> MoS (independent charge) for Petroleum & Natural Gas</h3><div class="pop-content"><p>The last two years have been a steep learning curve for Dharmendra Pradhan, MoS (independent charge) for petroleum and natural gas. A man who would struggle and fumble on energy metrics in presentations in his early days has, by and by, completely turned around a ministry which had been caught in several controversies in the past and was often considered too close to corporate interests.</p><p>"We draft policies for public good, not for stakeholders!" he thunders today. "A ministry that was once dismissed as another branch of the corporate affairs ministry is today working for the poor." It doesn't even feel out of place that Pradhan is dressed in a bright-pink linen kurta-an unusual colour for a male politician in India- because he is clearly one of the bright spots of the two-year-old NDA regime.</p><p>Only 44 when he took charge, Pradhan had legacy issues to deal with. There was corporate overhang, tight parliamentary scrutiny, and there were information leaks. Restoring credibility and transparency was his foremost priority, and he insists that the Prime Minister's Office closely tracking the ministry helped immensely.</p><p>"Whenever I need advice, the PM or the PMO are available," he says. "It was Modi who appealed to people to give up their LPG subsidy. I had my doubts, I had not imagined that one crore people would give up their subsidy. But they did." The Give It Up campaign saved the government about Rs 10,000 crore.</p><p>Considered to be in Arun Jaitley's "camp", Pradhan has strategically kept a low profile. There have been instances when goals or schemes regarding his ministry have been announced by Modi, and Pradhan has had to find ways to implement them. But, to his credit, he has managed to pull off the largest Direct Benefit Transfer system for LPG under which the government is subsidising to 15 crore of the 16.5 crore LPG consumers in India.</p><p>The ministry recently launched the Rs 8,000 crore Ujjwala scheme, which provides LPG cooking gas connections to BPL families. And Pradhan also managed to renegotiate India's LNG agreement with Qatar to bring down the cost of importing natural gas to less than $5 per unit from $12 per unit earlier after a sixmonth dialogue. "Renegotiating a longterm energy contract is not standard," says Dilip Khanna of Ernst & Young India.

Eighteen months ago, he inherited the task of fixing a parallel universe, India’s giant military-industrial complex and armed forces. Parrikar’s earnestness— a raft of committees to suggest ways to reduce arms imports, to make arms locally and also modernise the military, signalled a refreshing change from his lacklustre predecessor, A.K. Antony. The trouble is, after more than a year-and-a-half and plenty of promises, Parrikar has few concrete achievements. Only one key deal—a $3 billion dollar purchase of helicopter gunships and transport helicopters from the US—has been inked so far. Even ‘Make in India’ projects such as the Akash anti-aircraft missiles for the air force worth Rs 7,000 crore and the Pinaka multi-barreled rockets worth Rs 3,500 crore for the army are stuck.

Parrikar has set his sights on ending corruption in defence deals and bringing in transparency. His recent attack on the Congress over the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter bribery earned effusive praise from the PM.

This is less than the UPA-I’s average of 49 a year and UPA-II’s average of 46 per year. In the last two years, the government has drafted only 23 new bills. These numbers don’t speak highly of Naidu’s performance as parliamentary affairs minister but he gets the benefit of the doubt considering the Congress has used its majority in the Rajya Sabha to block the passage of bills.</p><p>As urban development minister, Naidu is in charge of multiple Modi government signature schemes such as Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana, Smart City Mission and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation. Progress on them has been slow due to lack of a viable fund structure. But Naidu believes it’s too early to evaluate their success. For the infrastructure improvement planned under Atal and Smart City missions, urban local bodies (ULBs) and states have come out with specific action plans for the first five years. The government aims at ensuring Swachh Bharat by 2019 and housing for all urban poor by 2022. The minister wants to see the ULBs and the states clean up urban areas. He also blames legacy issues such as deficiencies in urban planning and project formulation and their implementation, capacity constraints and weak resource base of ULBs. But Naidu is not ready to give up and is enthusiastic about a new working environment. He hopes to change the mindset of ULBs and states towards redesigning the urban landscape based on confidence, capacity building and collaborative effort. It’s this collaboration among the three agencies—Centre, state and civic bodies—that would determine the new urban landscape of India. </p><p><em>—by Kaushik Deka</em></p></div></div></div></div></li></ul><ul><li><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Good-5-6-Naidu+Jawedekar-May23-2.jpg" width="180" height="111" alt=""/><h3>Prakash Javadekar</h3><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="goldpopbox11" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'IT_narendera-modi-two-years_Page', 'click','Prakash Javadekar', 1, {'nonInteraction': 1});return true;">READ MORE</a><div id="goldpopbox11" class="gold-popupbox" style="display:none;"><a href="#" class="close"></a><div class="top-pop-row"><h4>Performers</h4></div><div class="outer-box"><div class="bot-pop-row"><h5>Climate Control</h5><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Good-5-6-Naidu+Jawedekar-May23-2.jpg" width="180" height="111" alt=""/><h2>Prakash Javadekar</h2><span class="rating"><a href="#" style="width:62%;"></a></span><span class="clear"></span><h3><em>65,</em> MoS for Environment, Forests & Climate Change</h3><div class="pop-content"><p>Climate change has been centrestage on the agendas of the last three environment ministers— Jairam Ramesh, Jayanti Natarajan and now Prakash Javadekar. The narrative around India’s position, how much to commit to internationally and whether to become part of a legally binding climate instrument has always been confused. When the Modi government took over in 2014, this discussion was poised at a crucial juncture and the environment ministry’s role in pushing India’s climate agenda globally was bigger than ever before. The government has managed to once again bring India back to a position of strength as far as international dialogue on climate change is concerned, post the success at the Paris Climate Summit in December 2015, and this remains one of Javadekar’s biggest achievements. Since coming to power, the government has stressed on easing some of the archaic rules and making green clearance procedures simpler, especially for key defence projects. Javadekar has had to do a tough balancing act, ensuring protection of the environment without slowing growth. He has sped up the process of environmental clearances—permissions that took an average of 600 days till 2014 are now cleared in 190 days.</p><p>The process has been uploaded on the MoEF website to ensure transparency. Javadekar plans to pare this wait down to 100 days. Project clearances of up to 40 hectares of forest land can now be cleared by regional offices to ensure that files don’t have to travel to Delhi.</p><p>India set an ambitious target of setting up an additional carbon sink of 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.

Drawing on lessons she imbibed from her highly successful businessman father Satyajit Majithia, Harsimrat works a gruelling daily routine shuttling between her ministry and her constituency Bathinda. Her 18-hour workdays end with checking the flood of e-mails she receives from friends, family and constituents. She plans to set up 37 food parks, of which eight are already up and running. Despite being a political novice, she can be persistent. Late last year, she prevailed upon PM Modi and the Cabinet to allow 100 per cent FDI in multi-brand retail of food produced and processed in the country. It was a significant personal victory, given the furious opposition to the move by the BJP and the RSS. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, the RSS's economic wing, resolved to continue their opposition to this FDI hike in their national executive. Harsimrat is unfazed. "It's our biggest achievement," she says, describing how the move will boost employment, cut wastage and control food inflation. She sees her job as an opportunity to change the lives of Indian farmers.</p><p><em>-by Anilesh Mahajan</em></p></div></div></div></div></li><li><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Average-5-6-May23-2.jpg" width="180" height="111" alt=""/><h3>Maneka Gandhi</h3><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="goldpopbox19" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'IT_narendera-modi-two-years_Page', 'click','Maneka Gandhi', 1, {'nonInteraction': 1});return true;">READ MORE</a><div id="goldpopbox19" class="gold-popupbox" style="display:none;"><a href="#" class="close"></a><div class="top-pop-row"><h4>So-So</h4></div><div class="outer-box"><div class="bot-pop-row"><h5>Mother Superior</h5><img src="http://itgd-mum-dev-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/others/mediaintoday/indiatoday/gold/CS-Average-5-6-May23-2.jpg" width="180" height="111" alt=""/><h2>Maneka Gandhi</h2><span class="rating"><a href="#" style="width:52%;"></a></span><span class="clear"></span><h3><em>59,</em> Minister for Women & Child Development</h3><div class="pop-content"><p>According to Maneka Gandhi, the ministry she heads was "virtually dead" when she took over in 2014.

Several legal and child rights activists have sharply criticised the move though. Many women's groups are of the opinion that the Modi government is only paying lip service to the welfare of mothers and the girl child, given the limited investment, yet the ministry seems to have taken some significant steps in the last two years.

India's civil aviation market is one of the fastest growing in the world: it grew by 28 per cent last year.
