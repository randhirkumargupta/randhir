          <h3>Episode 1: Renewable Energy Sector</h3>
          <p>In this episode, we journey into a sector, which promises dividends for future generations not just in India but around the world -- the Renewable Energy Sector.  India’s power sector is one of the most diversified in the world. Catering to rising energy demands, India has been increasingly diversifying into renewable energy (RE), thereby becoming one of the world’s most vibrant markets for this sector. The government's Make In India programme is giving further impetus to this sector.</p>
          <p>One company which is helping make this shift from conventional to non-conventional energy sources is ReNew Power. It is India's leading solar and wind energy company committed to delivering cleaner and smarter energy choices, thereby reducing India’s carbon footprint. With each passing year ReNew Power has set new goals. It has contributed 15% of total wind power capacity added in 2014, forayed into utility scale solar projects and commissioned large number of solar roof top projects.</p>
          <p>Today renewable energy contributes only 5% of the total energy requirements, but with the government's target of 175 GW till 2022, this sector is on the growth path. With companies like ReNew Power pitching in and the increasing investment in this sector, it is estimated that in 10 yrs from now most capacity addition will come from the area of renewable energy.</p>

		<h3>EPISODE 2: STEEL AND POWER SECTOR</h3>
          <p>In this episode we look at two sectors,  that are intrinsic to India's growth story.  The Steel and Power Sector are building the nation. India's Steel and Power sector is the backbone of the country's infrastructure. India is the world’s third largest producer of crude steel and is expected to become the second largest producer by 2016 end.</p>

          <p>With power generation, across India at over 250 Giga-watts, these two sectors are the mainstay of India's growth story. Jindal Steel and Power Limited under the leadership of Naveen Jindal is powering ahead to be a company that taps into its indigenous strength and innovations to put India on the route to sustainable growth - and be a global business hub for steel and power. </p>


          <p>With the  unique one- of -its kind coal gasification project Jindal Steel and Power, is also committed towards a greener carbon footprint. This is one of the most energy- efficient ways of producing and manufacturing Iron.</p>

		  <p>JSPL also reaches out to economically deprived communities across Orissa and Chhattisgarh, to identify individuals in need of healthcare. This is done via mobile and stationary dispensaries, trained women volunteers, nurses, ambulances. With a focus on Building India, social growth and inclusion and green practices Jindal Steel and Power is a company, that has taken 'Make in India' to heart.  </p>
         
         
			</br>
         

		<h3>EPISODE 3: AGRICULTURE SECTOR</h3>
          <p>This episode is dedicated to a sector on which about 65% of our population relies for employment and livelihood. It is a sector that has been the government's focus in its financial Budget for 2016.It is the Agriculture Sector. </p>

          <p>Second in farm and agricultural output, India's agricultural export forms about 10% of its overall exports. With an increasing focus on organic farming and sustainability, the demand for agricultural produce is on the rise. With the government's 'Make In India' programme easing business processes, introducing a single window approach in dealing with investments and 100% FDI in some cases, private sector participation might be seen as a more viable possibility.</p>


          <p>As the age of the farmer gets visibly younger, the demand and use of modern farming technologies experiences expansion. Addressing this very demand is New Holland Agriculture – a leading agricultural equipment brand recognised for its technological innovations worldwide.</p>

		  <p>New Holland is a brand of CNH Industrial, a global player with  uniquely diversified businesses in agricultural and construction equipment, commercial vehicles and powertrains; in India it operates in the agribusiness through the Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands. New Holland offers Indian farmers the widest and most specialized product offering in the market. It provides advanced solutions for the mechanization of agriculture which enhance crop productivity. The brand offers a technologically superior range of 35 to 90 horsepower tractors in India.</p>
