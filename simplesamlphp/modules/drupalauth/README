INTRODUCTION

This module for SimpleSAMLphp provides an Authentication Source for authenticating users against a local Drupal site. This allows the administrator to leverage the user management and integration capabilities of Drupal for managing the identity life cycle and the power of SimpleSAMLphp for identity integration.

NOTE: This is a simpleSAMLphp module, NOT a Drupal module. If you want to connect your Drupal site to a SAML or Shibboleth IdP, see the simplesamlphp_auth module for Drupal at http://drupal.org/project/simplesamlphp_auth.
